Employees at the 46-year-old establishment are doing double-speed, rush-hour duty, against the clang of steel plates and swirl of shouted orders, to serve its most popular dish \u2014 pav bhaji .  It is definitely not for the calorie-conscious. The pav (bread) glistens with golden butter and a generous slab of butter, the size of a small soap bar, slowly melts into the hot bhaji. That only seems to boost the demand for \u201cAmul Pav Bhaji\u201d, advertised prominently on the menu board for Rs 100. Appa Dandekar, who runs Cannon, says the stall has always used Amul and there is no question of using any other butter brand. \u201cPeople can tell the difference between Amul and others.\u201d  This kind of devotion to Amul Butter is what makes it the undisputed market leader, accounting for around 85% of the Rs 3,500 crore butter market in India, according to industry sources. More than six decades after it was launched, Amul Butter has managed to hold onto its dominance.  In the hyper competitive world of fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) \u2014 a low-margin, distribution and marketing-focused universe where customer loyalties tend to be fickle \u2014 a handful of legacy brands such as Amul Butter has managed to retain their market leadership over decades, fending off rivals, rapidly changing tastes and shifting market structures.  In some cases, the dominance is such that the category is defined by the brand. Instant noodles brand Maggi , Dabur Chyawanprash, Parle G, Rooh Afza and Diary Milk among food and drinks and Pidilite\u2019s Fevicol, an adhesive, are among these logic-defying brands.  All of them have been around for a while, making it clear that customer loyalty is earned slowly, but surely. But apart from longevity and the consistent nurturing of the brand itself, there is little that\u2019s discernibly common among them. Each product has had its own journey and challenges. So what lessons in success and leadership can be gleaned from the journey of these powerhouse brands?   Recall Value  For one, being a strong brand does not guarantee safety. Amul, for example, has to fight for market share with Parag Milk Foods and Britannia in cheese, and Nestle and Mother Dairy battle Amul in the packaged milk category. Amul\u2019s market share in the cheese and milk segments are pegged at 40-50% and 30%, respectively.  Research firms such as Nielsen and Euromonitor do not share market share figures with the media, and some market segments, such as butter, are not extensively tracked. ET Magazine has relied on data from industry sources, including figures from syndicated reports by market research firms.  But why do people invariably think of Amul while buying butter? Shirish Upadhyay, a dairy industry veteran who has worked in the private sector and with the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns the brand Amul, says Amul had a head start in butter.  The dairy sector was delicensed in 1991 but the brand had been launched in the 1950s and its famous \u201cUtterly Butterly\u201d slogan and the Amul girl created in 1966. \u201cAnd it is very competitively priced so it doesn\u2019t make sense for others to take on Amul.\u201d    Amul Butter Company: Amul, Market share of Amul Butter: 85%, Competitors: Heritage, Mother Dairy, Britannia  \u201cThere is a conscious effort to talk to younger people through Amul ads\u201d Rahul da Cunha, ad man behind Amul  Another reason is the distinct salty taste that Amul Butter had developed to take on then-market leader, Polson\u2019s Butter, in the 1950s.  Butter, which helped Amul build a national distribution network, has the highest cross-country penetration among all its products, says RS Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF. The company also sells ghee, buttermilk, ice cream and chocolates. GCMMF earned a revenue of Rs 33,150 crore in 2018-19. \u201cPeople have blind faith in the Amul Butter brand, like they have on their religion.\u201d  Rahul da Cunha, one of the brains behind the Amul girl advertisements, says one of the reasons for the endurance of the brand is its attempt to talk to younger people. \u201cWe are commenting not just on topics of national importance but also on topics of internet importance.\u201d   Riding on Nostalgia  Another popular brand that also used a little girl for branding is Parle-G biscuits. The packaging of the product launched in 1939 uses a picture of a little girl. Owned by Parle Products, the biscuit is a daily fixture in the lives of many Indians who like dunking it in their tea.  \u201cYou might try different biscuits. But when you want to have something every day, it is Parle-G,\u201d says Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. The biscuit accounts for fourfifths of the Rs 8,750 crore glucose biscuit market and operates at staggering scale. Available at 10 different price points from Rs 2 (with eight biscuits) to Rs 65 (with 160 biscuits), Parle-G is sold through 6.5 million outlets. A billion packets are sold every month. In 2011, Nieslen called it the world\u2019s largest-selling biscuit. The brand\u2019s chief competitors are Britannia\u2019s Tiger and ITC\u2019s Sunfeast Glucose, which account for a tenth of the market.  To take on the competition, Parle-G reinvented the brand and termed the \u201cG\u201d in the name \u201cgenius\u201d. Shah says Tiger and Sunfeast only ate into the market share of the smaller players. Parle-G\u2019s share has grown from 68% to 80% in the past two decades, he adds.    Parle-G Company: Parle Products Market share of Parle-G in glucose biscuits: 80%, Competitors: Tiger, Sunfeast Glucose  Britannia declined to comment for the story and ITC did not respond to queries. These two companies are no less aggressive when it comes to pricing and distribution, but Tiger and Sunfeast Glucose, launched in 1997 and 2003, respectively, do not \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 have Parle-G\u2019s biggest selling point \u2014 a multi-generational connection with the brand.  Nostalgia certainly helps a brand, says Siddharth Shekhar Singh, associate professor of marketing at the Indian School of Business. \u201cBut if customers don\u2019t find value in it, then (future) generations may remember the brand but not use it.\u201d  Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez India, concurs. \u201cNostalgia is a dangerous thing. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go.\u201d  Mondelez accounts for twothirds of the Rs 10,430 crore chocolate market in India, according to Nielsen data shared by industry insiders. Their flagship brand Cadbury Dairy Milk, launched in India in 1948, alone has a 41% market share.  There was a time most Indians did not have access to have premium chocolates and made do with whatever was available. But, Viswanathan says, that started changing around a decade ago when people realised there were no good premium chocolates in India. That was when the company launched Dairy Milk Silk, which starts at Rs 70. The company\u2019s premium range of chocolates like Silk and Bournville necessitated an increase in the number of coolers in stores.    Dairy Milk has also been helped in no small measure by some of India\u2019s most memorable commercials and taglines since the 1990s, created by Ogilvy & Mather (O&M), including \u201cAsli swad zindagi ka (The real taste of life)\u201d and \u201cKuchh meetha ho jaaye (Let\u2019s have something sweet)\u201d.    Dairy Milk, Company: Mondelez Market share 41 % of Dairy Milk: Competitors: Nestle, Amul  \u201cNostalgia is a dangerous thing for brands. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go\u201d Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez  Smart advertising, also by O&M, has also built Fevicol and its associate brands like Fevikwik and M-Seal. Owned by Pidilite Industries, the brands are said to control around 70% of the adhesives market. In a largely unorganised industry, Fevicol has the stickiness its competitors would kill for. A June 2017 research report by Credit Suisse on Pidilite says the incentive for carpenters to switch to another brand was low, as adhesives make up only 1-2% of the cost of making furniture.       Fevicol Company: Pidilite Market share of Fevicol 70% & Associate Brands like Fevikwik: Competitors: Jivanjor, Araldite   One of the secrets to the brand\u2019s success was that unlike its competitors, it did not go just to distributors, but also engaged the end-users, in this case carpenters, masons and plumbers. In 2002, it even started a club for carpenters, the first of its kind, through which it conducts training programmes and cultural events for carpenters\u2019 families. This club, which now has 1 lakh members in 600 towns, allows them to showcase new products to carpenters, a luxury Pidilite\u2019s competitors do not have.  Just like Fevicol is used to refer to adhesives in general, rose-flavoured sherbets are in some quarters referred to as Rooh Afza. The Hamdard Laboratories\u2019 brand, which reportedly accounts for nearly half of the Rs 1,000 crore syrup and concentrate market, was in the news recently because there was a shortage of the product during Ramzan. A large section of people break their iftar fast with Rooh Afza.  The market leader faces no real competition in some product categories. But there are also segments where newer players have given the top brand a serious scare. One such segment is chyawanprash. The product was long synonymous with Dabur, which has a nearly 60% share in the Rs 540 crore market. Baba Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali has within a few years of its launch become the third largest player in the market, after Dabur and Baidyanath. But the sheen has started wearing off Patanjali due to increasing competition and distribution woes.  While Dabur and Baidyanath saw their market shares by volume rise in 2018-19 from 2017-18, Patanjali\u2019s declined. Prashant Agarwal, marketing head-health supplements, Dabur, says Patanjali had a short-term impact and Dabur has made up for the loss in market share. \u201cWhile people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons.\u201d  Dabur Chyawanprash, launched in 1949, for a long time enjoyed the benefits of being India\u2019s first branded chyawanprash. But with increasing competition, the company has made a concerted attempt to reach out to a younger consumer base through brand ambassadors like cricketer MS Dhoni and Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishan, who is quite popular in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and make chyawanprash more palatable to kids by launching it in flavors like mango and chocolate.    Dabur Chyawanprash Company: Dabur Market share of Dabur Chyawanprash: Competitors: 59%, Baidyananth, PatanjaliGlucose    Unlike in chyawanprash, it was not competition that posed a threat to Nestle in instant noodles. Maggi was synonymous instant noodles. But the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India\u2019s decision in June 2015 to recall Maggi noodles over the presence of lead beyond the permissible limit and due to misleading labelling related to monosodium glutamate gave the brand a severe beating. Six months later, Maggi was back on the shelves, though the market share had nearly halved from 80% in 2014, according to Nestle data.    \u201cWhile people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons\u201d Prashant Agarwal marketing head, health supplements, Dabur   However, the power of the brand and the company\u2019s outreach saw Maggi through those trying times. The product\u2019s market share is now almost 60%, according to Nestle. \u201cIt was quite telling who consumers were willing to trust, the government or Maggi,\u201d says Alpana Parida, MD of DY Works, a brand consultancy.    Maggi, Company: Nestle Market share of Maggi: 59% Competitors: Wai Wai, Top Ramen,adequate   Brand Trap Nestle India did not respond to ET Magazine's specific questions, except to say Maggi has a strong resonance among consumers. Maggi's competitors include Sunfeast Yippee, Wai Wai and Top Ramen. Yippee, launched in 2010, has become the second largest brand, with a fifth of the market, riding ITC's distribution muscle, but it still does not immediately bring to mind noodles the way Maggi does.  Being a well-known brand of a big company can be a trap in itself. \"These companies are usually large-sized and due to their sheer size, it is challenging for them to be agile and provide a quick response to innovations and changing consumer needs,\" says Ina Dawer, research manager at Euromonitor International.  Staying relevant is a constant battle. The numerous onceubiquitous brands that have fallen by the wayside stand testimony to this brutal market truth.

According to the global market research firm Forrester, the online retail sales in India will grow at a five-year CAGR of 25.8 per cent to reach $85 billion by 2023, despite the hiccups of demonetization in 2016, GST in 2017 and the governmental changes in eCommerce policy announced last December.  The time is ripe for Reliance Retail, which operates 10,415 stores in more than 6,600 cities, with 500 million annual footfalls - giving the company the kind of scale required to swiftly launch India-based operations.  \"One of the things that will trouble Amazon and Flipkart is Reliance's history of launching operations via massive discounts,\" Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research , said on Tuesday.  Reliance entered the telecom sector in 2003 with the Monsoon Hungama tariff plan, which brought tariffs for voice calls down to just Rs 0.40 a minute from the existing rate of Rs 2 a minute, followed by the launch of Jio 4G plan in 2016 that dropped data rates from Rs 250 per GB to Rs 50 per GB.  \"This kind of discounting can disrupt any market, and we expect something similar to happen in the grocery space during Reliance is launch,\" Meena added.  Reliance is fast working on creating the world's largest online-to-offline New Commerce Platform, according to Mukesh Ambani , Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries .  \"Due to the recent changes in eCommerce policy and the restrictions on an inventory-led model for marketplaces with FDI, Reliance Retail is finding a favourable policy environment to launch operations where it can use its existing retail infrastructure to deliver goods to customers,\" the Forrester report noted.  Reliance launched the food and grocery app among its employees in April 2019 to prepare for the commercial launch later in the year.  Reliance Retail is the largest retailer in India, with $18.7 billion in revenue during financial year 2019, and it grew at a CAGR of 55 per cent in the last five years.  Reliance Retail had $81 billion in revenue and $9.4 billion in profit during 2019.  \"This gives Reliance Retail access to long-term capital from the conglomerate, which has a presence in energy, petrochemicals, telecom, textiles, retail, and natural resources,\" said Forrester.  Reliance Retail also has a portfolio of over 40 brands, from the midmarket to premium segments and including Hamleys (which the company has acquired for Rs 620 crore) and Marks & Spencer.  \"These can provide a boost to the fashion and lifestyle segment, which will be the largest category by online spending in the coming years,\" said the report.  Reliance launched its mobile business at the end of 2015, and by April 2019, it had over 300 million mobile subscribers a\" making it the third-largest player in a short span of time.  Jio is building on these mobile subscribers by investing in related services to create an ecosystem that gives customers access to rich content and payments options.  This ecosystem will be available for Reliance Retail to build on.  To compete with Amazon and Flipkart, Reliance will have to significantly improve the customer experience, both in stores and on its online channel, because discounts and cashbacks will not generate loyalty for online customers a\" as we saw in the Paytm Mall case.  \"Removal of discounts may lead to a significant loss of buyers from the platform. The positioning of the Reliance platform and its fulfilment will play a critical role in the fight against Amazon and Flipkart,\" emphasised the Forrester report.  The eCommerce competition in India remains fierce.  Amazon has been the most popular online retailer since it surpassed Flipkart in 2016, although Flipkart is still the single-largest online retailer, with 31.9 per cent market share in 2018 (38.4 per cent if you include Myntra and Jabong), closely followed by Amazon at 31 per cent.

The market was betting on expected pre-buying in the second half of FY20 before expensive BS-VI vehicles roll out in April 2020, to sustain double-digit growth. But slowing consumption and industrial activity could weigh on the commercial vehicles market, moderating the pace of growth to single digits.  Girish Wagh, president of the CV unit at Tata Motors , said the market may slip to a single digit growth even after the expected pre-buying. \u201cManufacturing output is slowing, consumption is slowing, and so is execution of infrastructure projects,\u201d said Wagh. \u201cThis is having a compounding effect on demand.  Retail growth may be in double digits, but due to transition from BS IV to BS VI, the stock will be calibrated.\u201d    New axle-load norms implemented in September 2018 led to increased capacity of 15-20% overnight, and that is still getting absorbed. NBFCs that finance more than half of new truck sales are not in robust health and tight liquidity is affecting vehicle financing.  To be sure, sales of commercial vehicles have slowed down since the second half of FY19. Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) fell in five out of the last six months. MHCV volume growth in the second half of FY19 fell 4.5%, compared with 62% growth in the first half. In April, MHCV sales dropped 14% to 28,604 units. The head of the CV business at Tata Motors believes a clear mandate for the ruling coalition should accelerate federal investment on infrastructure, helping drive the demand for trucks.  Wagh, however, is worried about the trend in oil prices. \u201cIf oil prices go up, the rise has an impact on government finances and that may have a say on spending. We have seen the right intent from government and central bank to kickstart demand, and one is hoping for a pick-up in H2.\u201d  Meanwhile, the light commercial vehicles segment, which has been one of the fastest growing in the Indian auto industry, is dependent on consumption-driven sectors and ecommerce . Irregular monsoons or slowdown in consumption can adversely affect the growth. It expanded 19% in FY19 but analysts expect growth to be moderate this fiscal due to high base effect. LCV sales fell 1.1% in April to 43,955.  According to rating agency ICRA , vehicle prices could increase 10-12% from next April when new emission standards are adopted. That should lead to strong pre-buying in H2 of FY20.  Shamsher Dewan, V-P and sector head - corporate ratings at ICRA, has retained the 10-12% growth rate target for FY20, but cautioned that if the ongoing NBFC crisis continued, ICRA might have to review its forecast, with a downward bias.

The Hinduja Group has engaged investment bankers led by SBI Capital Markets for due diligence, which will commence soon, said people with knowledge of the matter.  Sources close to Naresh Goyal and the Hindujas said they share cordial ties that go back more than two decades. They said the Hindujas expect the banks to take a sizeable haircut\u2014initial calculations peg Jet\u2019s dues at Rs 12,000 crore.  India\u2019s leading conglomerates had declined approaches by Jet\u2019s banks and Goyal for a possible rescue. The Tata Group had shown an inclination to consider a bid for the airline but subsequently lost interest, said the people cited above. The Hinduja Group had in the past eyed Air India when the state-run, heavily indebted airline came up for privatisation. It had also tied up with Lufthansa AirCargo for services between Sharjah and India in 1997-2000.      Several Levels of Due Diligence  Jet is running out of time as its pilots are being hired by rivals in India and abroad.  Apart from that, its much-coveted overseas routes are being eyed by rival airlines. The aviation regulator has handed over some of its domestic routes to rivals temporarily. ET reported on Monday that Air India has been given half of Jet\u2019s busiest overseas routes with the rest to be shared out among domestic carriers, also on a temporary basis, pending Jet\u2019s possible revival.  To be sure, it\u2019s not at all certain that Jet has found a saviour yet, said a person close to the development. \u201cAny investor will have to wade through several levels of due diligence,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the audited financial results, no investor can be sure of the gaping hole that is Jet\u2019s accounts at this point.\u201d  At least 30 Jet commanders flying long-haul, wide-bodied aircraft have applied to Turkish, Korean Air, Qatar Airways and Rwanda Air for jobs, said people with knowledge of the matter. Closer home, IndiGo has hired over 30 Jet pilots who flew Boeing 737s. The pilots will be inducted after training on IndiGo\u2019s Airbus 320s, sources said. IndiGo had offered Rs 15-20 lakh as sign-on bonus for Jet Airways pilots for a limited period of time.  Anyone looking to revive the carrier will have to start from scratch, since the top management at Jet has quit. The support of Goyal and Etihad is therefore crucial, said the people cited above. The Hinduja Group will also gauge the level of support from the government and bankers for a revival plan before making a final move. Another aspect of the Hinduja Group is that their acquisitions are predicated on gaining majority control.

Musk wants to make India his next big market but the question lingers: Will the electric car ever run on the bumpy 'desi' roads?  According to Venkatesh Natarajan , Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Ashok Leyland, the company is open to Musk for a partnership to finally let Indians experience his path-breaking autonomous Tesla electric cars.  \"We are open to Musk's offer. I truly believe that it's not just one partner who can contribute to the electric car dream in India. There are multiple agencies who will be involved in this. We will be lucky to be part of that consortium,\" Natarajan told IANS on the sidelines of the just-concluded AWS India Summit here in the financial capital.  \"I go back to the organisation's philosophy and culture. Whenever we see new technology, we like to try it out, just like a small kid who sees a new toy and wants to experiment. We are open in terms of technology adoption -- anything that adds value to our customers,\" Natarajan noted.  The company, flagship of the Hinduja Group, reported a revenue of Rs 6,325 crore in Q3 (FY 2018-19). Year-to-Date (YTD) revenues touched Rs 20,209 crore, up 15 per cent over corresponding period last year.  Rating agency ICRA recently upgraded the long-term rating of fund-based limits of Ashok Leyland to AA+ from AA with stable outlook. The agency believes that Ashok Leyland's financial profile will remain healthy supported by stable demand outlook for the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment and light commercial vehicle (LCV) segments.  Touted as India's largest bus manufacturer and the fourth largest in the world, the company reported 10 per cent rise in the domestic vehicles sales at 13,141 units in April 2019. The commercial vehicles company had sold 11,951 vehicles in domestic market during the same month last year.  \"Ultimately, we need more money. We are in the business of making money. As long as we are able to make more money and help our customers generate more money, we are game to every new technology,\" Natarajan emphasised.  Ashok Leyland's offer must be a sweet news to Musk's ears. Breaking his silence over India plans after 10 months, Musk tweeted in March that he would love to be in India in 2019 or next year.  \"Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next! India,\" Musk tweeted to a user.  Musk earlier blamed the Indian government's policies for giving up on his India dreams. He also blamed the FDI norms for the delay in the electric car maker's entry into the Indian market.  \"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately,\" Musk tweeted in response to a Twitter user who wrote \"No Tesla in India\" on his Twitter handle.  Earlier this year, Tesla's Indian-origin Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja announced his retirement from the firm, bringing Musk's India dream to a halt again.  Tesla was expected to enter India with the Model 3 that sells for nearly $35,000.

Jaypee Infratech's lenders have started negotiations with NBCC on the latter's bid to acquire the realty firm.  Last week, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ) had annulled voting by homebuyers and lenders on NBCC's bid and allowed renegotiation on the offer by May 30. Voting process could start from May 31.  According to sources, lenders have shown reluctance to acquire up to 2,207 unsold flats worth Rs 1,756 crore as proposed by NBCC in its revised offer.  NBCC is ready to negotiate on its proposal related to unsold flats, they added.  However, sources said NBCC is unlikely to dilute its conditions related to exemption of tax liabilities.  In its revised offer, NBCC proposed infusion of Rs 200 crore equity capital, transfer of 950 acres of land worth Rs 5,000 crore as well as Yamuna Expressway to banks and completion of flats by July 2023 in order to settle an outstanding claim of Rs 23,723 crore of financial creditors.  Last week, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) decided to put on vote the revised offer of NBCC, with homebuyers favouring the voting process while bankers dissenting.  Lenders had written to the NBCC seeking clarifications on certain concessions sought by the public sector firm in its resolution plan.  However, NBCC decided not to dilute the conditions of exemption from income tax liability as well as from taking consent of development authorities for transfer of businesses.  Clarifications from the NBCC were sought in the wake of the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) flagging to the lenders that NBCC's bid was conditional and non-binding.  The IRP Anuj Jain had written to the CoC that NBCC's revised bid was conditional as the plan would not be binding unless key relief measures such as extinguishing of income tax liability and exemption from seeking consent of YEIDA (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) for any business transfer, were taken.  Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency process in 2017 after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of the realty firm.  In the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350-crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha Group, was rejected by lenders.  Later in October 2018, the IRP started the second round of bidding process to revive Jaypee Infratech on the direction of NCLT.  Earlier this month, creditors, including banks and homebuyers, rejected a bid by Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty through a voting process, following which the CoC decided to consider NBCC's offer.", "published_date": "May 22, 2019, 10.36 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:51:53", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/jaypee-infratech-lenders-start-negotiations-on-nbccs-bid-as-per-nclat-order/articleshow/69449779.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Several retailers confirmed this to ET and said other smartphone makers have approached them underlining why Huawei\u2019s handsets should not be pushed.     Google had on Monday announced restrictions on Huawei\u2019s access to its Android operating system in line with an executive order from US president Donald Trump. While the US technology major on Wednesday put off this decision for 90 days after US temporarily eased the ban on Huawei, Indian retailers are still wary of recommending the brand to their customers.  \u201cWith the news of Google stopping services to Huawei, though they have been granted extension of 90 days, I wouldn't like my customers to face any problem in future regarding the updates, so will have to divert it to other brands,\u201d Manish Khatri of Mumbai-based retailer Mahesh Telecom told ET.  Huawei \u2014 the world\u2019s second largest smartphone maker by shipments that enjoys 4.5% share in the Indian market \u2014 currently sells around 85% of its Honor and Huawei branded phones through online partners. But it is trying to rapidly expand the offline channel to close in on top players such as Xiaomi, Samsung, Oppo and Vivo. It has already struck a partnership with Tatas\u2019 electronics retail chain Croma for its premium phones.  Ritesh Ghosal, chief marketing officer at Infinity Retail which operates Croma, said the firm continues to sell its existing stock of Huawei devices and that it hasn\u2019t received any communication from its partner.  \u201cOur understanding is this (Android support issue) will affect the future models, and will not be supported by Google,\u201d he told ET.  Some recently launched models of Huawei, like P30 Pro, are already unavailable at some Delhi-based Croma outlets.  Another retailer said handsets like P30 Pro and Mate 20 Pro had just started to fetch consumer interest due to premium camera features and build quality, but the new development will hurt their sales. \u201cExisting Huawei customers are worried about the resale value, which surely will take a hit in the absence of future Google support,\u201d said the person who chose to be anonymous.  Huawei, in a statement, said it will continue to sell Android-based smartphones from its existing stocks in India and support the ones that are in use. Poorvika, an offline partner of Huawei in southern India, said Huawei remains a popular brand in its outlets.

An offshoot of the high-street fashion label, H&M Home sells products such as cushion covers, blankets, curtains and accessories. \u201cWe are looking at the home segment and it will be decoration products and not furniture. There are not many players in that category and the product range doesn't change for years. In the organised sector, our strength will be the latest assortment,\u201d said H&M's India chief executive Janne Einola.  The company hasn't decided whether its furnishing-retail foray will be through a standalone format or existing stores would be leveraged to sell new product lines. Globally, H&M Home is mostly present with 362 shop-in-shops and eight standalone stores, in about 50 countries. With annual sales of `1,109 crore in India, H&M, the world\u2019s second-largest clothing firm, has surpassed all apparel brands except Zara in revenue after three years of India operations. The Stockholm-based retailer stocks fast-fashion items created in-house, and teams up with designers for one-time collections.  It keeps a large inventory of basic, everyday items sourced from manufacturers in India and Bangladesh. These items carry lower price tags than those sold by rivals. Foreign single-brand retailers need to meet 30% local sourcing norms to operate their own stores in the country. H&M said India is a large global supplier for home products and if these items are sold locally, the sourcing norms would be met.  That would give the company significant cost advantages. \u201cA bulk of sourcing for home products globally is from India and we\u2019ll benefit in terms of sourcing, given these will be made in India and sold here too,\u201d added Einola. Rising demand for premium and high-margin home furnishing products has drawn organised players to a segment that is largely unorganized in the country.

A senior government official aware of the deliberations told ET that the steering committee on transformative mobility has proposed banning all internal combustion engine (ICE) threewheelers on Indian roads by March 31, 2023, and two-wheelers below 150 cc by March 31, 2025, as part of a larger plan to make India the hub for manufacturing electric vehicles.  The cut-off date will also see the government roll out a comprehensive scrapping policy and \u2018polluter-pays\u2019 model to encourage rapid transition to electric vehicles, the official said. About 78% of all vehicles sold in the country are two wheelers and three wheelers.     According to the official, the committee has proposed doubling the subsidy for electric three-wheelers under FAME II scheme to Rs 20,000 per kwh to bring initial prices of electric three-wheelers on a par with ICE three-wheelers.  Under the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle mooted by Niti Aayog, it was suggested that a fee will be imposed on ICE vehicles and the funds thus collected will be utilised for offering rebate on purchase of electric vehicles, charging infrastructure and establishing battery plants of at least one gigawatt capacity.  According to the minutes of the third meeting of the steering committee, which were seen by ET, the ministry of road transport and highways has been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that from April 1, 2023 only electric three-wheelers are sold under the three-wheeler category.  After March 31, 2025 all new sales under category of two-wheelers below 150 cc will have to be electric vehicles running on lithium-ion batteries.

While consolidation tops the agenda, a list of directions is being separately worked out for state-owned lenders to focus on risk assessment, enhanced early warning signals in cases of stressed assets and bringing in new fintech players .  \u201cWe will soon be initiating the second round of reforms through our EASE (enhanced access and service excellence) programme,\u201d a finance ministry official told ET on condition of anonymity.  PSBs have already been asked to carry out an internal assessment for shortlisting ideal candidates for possible mergers or acquisitions. \u201cTwo separate processes are simultaneously being carried out.... The government has some combinations in mind and based on the inputs it receives from lenders, it will take a final call,\u201d said the official.  Some possible combinations revolve around big lenders such as the Punjab National Bank and Bank of India . Last year the government had initiated reforms for PSBs under EASE programme and directed these lenders to draw up a boardapproved strategic vision consistent with their risk-appetite framework.  \u201cWe have been holding discussions and reviews with PSBs in the last two months. Based on that we will soon roll out measures for prudential and clean lending,\u201d said another finance ministry official.  The new performance parameters that may be introduced this year through the EASE programme include more stringent early warning signals (EWS) to tackle stressed assets, effective coordination in large value loans and bringing in new financial technology players to deepen financial inclusion and digitalisation.  Another suggestion is to reconstitute the management committee of the board which takes decisions on large value loans and have representation from risk management, said the second official.  Separately, the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) has selected around 80 chief general managers (CGMs) from all PSBs who will be trained in globally acclaimed management institutes such as the Kellogg School of Management in the United States. \u201cThis is to create a pipeline for future heads in PSBs and also to address the knowledge gap in key functioning areas of banks,\u201d said the official.

Jet\u2019s grounding however helped bigger rival IndiGo to control 50% of the Indian domestic market, followed at a considerable distance by Air India and SpiceJet .  Indian carriers flew 11.3 million passengers locally in April, down about 2% from 11.5 million in the same month last year, according to data released by the country's aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The last time traffic declined was in June 2013\u20143% to 4.86 million passengers, after Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines shut shop. Local traffic in March 2019 increased a tad to 11.60 million from 11.58 million in the same month the previous year. Traffic growth rate, till last year at robust double digits, had fallen to low single digits since February.     Jet grounded its operations on April 17, running out of money and failing to raise funds to stay afloat. It started grounded large swathes of its capacity in February. More than 800 daily flights were pulled out of the market, leading to a capacity cut, which ultimately shrank the market in April.  Jet\u2019s key slots and several planes, deregistered due to non payment of lease rentals, have been allocated on a temporary basis to rival carriers. This will likely lead to an interesting reshuffle in market share in the coming months.  Meanwhile, IndiGo controlled 49.9% of the local flyers market in April, growing its share from 42.5% in January, when Jet was still operating a significant chunk of its capacity. Air India, at number 2, controlled about 14% up from 12.2% in January, while SpiceJet accounted for 13.1%.  Jet received the highest passenger complaints in April, 52.9 for every 10,000 passengers, primarily related to refunds for cancelled flights.

Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector.  The report comes against the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India's decision to create a specialised cadre to supervise and regulate the financial sector, including banks and NBFCs.  The Indian shadow banking industry's rapid growth and reliance on short-term funding sources \"bubbled over\" in 2018, most evident by the default of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) in September last year, the report said.  Default by IL&FS, it said, translated into higher borrowing costs and reduced market access for other non-bank financial institutions, leading to domestic regulators to re-examine liquidity norms for the sector and prod banks to increase their lending to, and asset purchases from, such entities.  \"Fitch believes these dynamics will weigh on growth prospects for the sector and likely lead to industry consolidation,\" the report said.  The cash-strapped IL&FS group is sitting on a debt of about Rs 94,000 crore. The management of the company's board has been taken over a government-appointed directors.  Several group companies have defaulted on the payment of interest payment on loans  The report also noted that the Indian shadow banking system has grown rapidly over the last decade, with a particular spike in 2017 driven by finance companies providing asset finance and home loans and funds investing in infrastructure loans.

For starters, the boiling issues of reviewing of levies and fees such as license fee, spectrum usage charges (SUC) and defining what does the government mean by adjusted gross revenue (AGR), will have to be taken up, said industry executives. These issues have also been highlighted in the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), the fast implementation of which will also be a key milestone for the new government to achieve.  \u201cReducing the high tax burden on telcos - a sector that is taxed between 29% and 33% of revenue- and encouraging investments in broadband infrastructure , are among other key demands of the beleaguered industry\u201d reeling under debt of more than Rs 7 lakh crore, said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). The industry group represents all the three major Indian telcos Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm.  Despite the pressures on profits and revenues, telcos must pay up for buying spectrum or airwaves to ensure smooth communications - over voice and now increasingly over video. However, the new government will have to balance the demand for lowering spectrum base prices and allocating spectrum at the right price to ensure no loss to the exchequer. At the same time, it will have to ensure that there's adequate spectrum being put up for sale at every auction.  The issue of levying blanket penalties on erring telcos would also require a relook, as per industry executives. A decision on levying a collective penalty of Rs 3050 crore on Airtel, Idea and Vodafone for flouting license norms, is also pending with the ministry.  The new ministry will have another demand of making telecom sector an essential and critical services sector, something that the previous government has believed in as well but has been unable to put into action.  In the medium term, the new government would need to think of taking fibre to a lot more towers than at present. India's fibre connectivity to towers stands at 20-25%, far lower than say in Singapore or China where its three times that. Taking fibre to the tower will provide high network capacity and enable telcos to offer 5G services in the future.  Creation of a national digital grid by establishing a national fibre authority would allow the government to implement the policy level plans on the ground.  With the industry coming down to just three players barring state run carriers, the telcos' demand to review mergers and acquisition rules may not hold much ground in today's context. However, for the future growth of the sector - as and when new players come - it must lay down a process to reform the rules to enable simplification and fast tracking of approvals.

Two closely held firms controlled by Essel promoters have not submitted the customary \u2018no-default certificate\u2019 to the rating agency, Acuit\u00e9, which tracks the debt while the private sector lender is silent on whether the borrowing companies have missed servicing loans.  Besides raising funds through sale of stock-backed debt securities to mutual funds, some of the Essel Group companies have drawn loans from Yes Bank on the back of comfort letters or guarantees from promoters.  Responding to ET\u2019s queries, an Essel Group spokesman said: \u201cEssel Business Excellence and Essel Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd have availed borrowings from Yes Bank and the said accounts were \u2018standard\u2019 as on 31/03/2019 and continue to be \u2018standard\u2019 as on date.\u201d  When contacted, a Yes Bank spokesman declined to comment on the matter.  A loan account, according to banking parlance, remains \u2018standard\u2019 till it gets the tag of non-performing asset (NPA), which happens only if there is non-payment of dues within 90 days from the due date.  (Thus, hypothetically, any borrower which fails to pay loan interest on March 31can technically remain \u2018standard\u2019 in the bank\u2019s book till end-June). The Essel official did not elaborate on why \u2018no-default certificate\u2019 from the borrowing firms were pending.  Industry sources said Acuit\u00e9 could not obtain the information from Yes, the lending bank. There is no compulsion, however, on the part of Yes (or, any lender) to disclose information to rating agencies \u2014 a state of affairs that agencies complain have placed them as well as investors at a disadvantage.  Unlike a default on debenture or bond, which investors come to know immediately, only banks and the Reserve Bank of India are privy to information on delay in loan servicing. A \u2018standstill agreement\u2019 between Essel and some of the fund houses (which have subscribed to Essel group\u2019s rated debentures) is under force. However, unlike mutual funds, banks, which have to follow strict prudential guidelines laid down by RBI, are not free to strike such deals with borrowers. In fact, Sebi, after its initial silence on the agreement, has recently questioned the pact which was entered into soon after shares of Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group companies Zee and Dish TV plunged in late January.  Bank term loan facilities of Rs 495 crore to Essel Corporate Resources as well as Rs 400 crore to Essel Business Excellence are under \u2018rating watch\u2019. \u201cA non-submission of no-default certificate is a trigger for the rating agency but it does not necessarily mean that the security is in for downgrade.  Agencies, typically, approach lending banks in trying to find out if there is any default. But, there is no regulation that compels banks to share such information to anyone other than RBI. But if there is a downgrade on loans, ratings of Essel debentures could come for examination,\u201d said a senior official at a bond house.  Ratings of the two companies were placed on \u2018watch\u2019 after Essel promoters announced their intentions to dilute holding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises , the group flagship. The agency perceives that the financial flexibility of the promoters of Essel Group emanates from their holdings in their listed companies, mainly ZEE Ltd.

The estimated cost for implementing phase I of 0.5 million TEUs is between USD 220-230 million and phase II expansion to 0.8 million TEUs is expected to cost between USD 55\u201360 million,\" it added.  The terminal will have a quay length of 635 meters with capability to handle three vessels at a time.  APSEZ said it would introduce its operating and technological expertise to Myanmar by using modern equipment to ensure efficient handling of containers, thereby reducing the average turnaround time of vessels.  All requisite clearances/permissions for setting up the terminal have been received in the form of Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) permit, it added.  \"We are proud to be the first Indian company to set up a container terminal outside India. With a good balance of EXIM trade and a ten per cent growth prospect, the project is an ideal investment for us. The terminal will generate meaningful employment for over 1,100 local people,\" Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ, said.", "published_date": "May 23, 2019, 02.24 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:51:54", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/shipping-/-transport/adani-ports-to-set-up-first-container-terminal-outside-india-in-myanmar/articleshow/69461515.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

There may be a fear that an infant can sink or get suffocated between two heavy people as those mattresses are very soft. But I am telling you, it just can\u2019t happen with our mattresses.\u201d  Twenty-first-century urban lifestyles have spawned many nightmares. Welcome to the most terrifying of them all. Your infant sinking \u2014 and slowly choking \u2014 in your soft and snuggly mattress . Wait \u2014 a killer mattress? What kind of dopey practical joke is this? Hold my pillow and let me tell you a story.      How a NASA Project Landed on Your Bed  Most Indians will buy any mattress as long as it looks thick, says Karthik Srinivasan, a brand and communications expert based in Bengaluru.  I fell into the same category till my body cried out against our brick-like mattress earlier this year. After a long and confusing search for a replacement, I chanced upon a pristine white \u201corthopaedic\u201d mattress at furniture retailer Urban Ladder\u2019s store in Noida. It made me groan with pleasure. I was told that beneath the mattress\u2019s hospital-like brand name \u2014 \u201cTheramedic\u201d \u2014 lay a magical invention: memory foam.  This type of foam was born out of a 1970s NASA project to improve seat cushioning and crash protection for airline pilots and passengers. The material moulds itself under your body heat and pressure and \u201cremembers\u201d your posture \u2014 hence memory foam.  In the past five years, the memory-foam bedding market has exploded in the United States. The country\u2019s online mattress market is said to be valued at nearly $30 billion. Casper, an online mattress seller launched in 2014, has raised $340 million in funding and is valued at over $1 billion.  Like in the US, in India too, a rash of online mattress startups has sprung up. This segment is projected to be worth Rs 300 crore by next year. And all across, memory foam is touted as the cool new thing. Body pain appears to be driving up the demand for memory foam.  According to pharma major GSK\u2019s 2017 Global Pain Index, after Poland, India reported the highest average number of sick days due to body pain. I am clearly not the only one waking up sore and looking for a better mattress.  \u201cLifestyle coupled with increased awareness that mattress and health go hand-in-hand is aiding the growth of the market,\u201d says Ashutosh Vaidya, chief marketing officer at Kurl-On, one of India\u2019s largest mattress sellers.  He estimates the Indian mattress industry to reach Rs 14,000 crore by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 9%.  These are exciting times for mattress buyers like me. Siddiq, a former investment banker who founded Sleepy Cat in 2017 after a stint in his family's traditional mattress business, says mattress shopping in India used to be a \"nightmare\".  \"There's joy in buying a TV or a sofa but buying a mattress is seen as a chore. We wanted to make this industry desirable, fun and better,\" he says. Indeed, the musty old industry now has a sexy new name: \"sleep solutions\".  But what's all this talk about 'killer' mattresses? While Googling memory foam, I find Dr Kathy Gromer of Minnesota Sleep Institute. Speaking to WebMD.com, Gromer drops this bombshell: \"Soft bedding traps [carbon dioxide] and increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome\". Bonkers!  There is also this from Amerisleep, a company in the very business of selling memory foam mattresses: \"The same body-contouring properties that have made memory foam products famous worldwide... can pose a danger to infants\u00a1K. primarily because kids of this age may not be able to turn themselves over at night which can become dangerous on a soft or contouring material.\"  Kurl-on's Vaidya cautions me as well, though not in such dire words. \"When placed flat on his belly, a baby instinctively uses his arms to raise his head and shoulders off the floor,\" he says. \"This move helps him strengthen the muscles he needs to flip. The sinking effect of the memory foam may act as obstacle in the initial phase of muscle gain and roll-over learning.\"  Staring guiltily at my 15-month-old, I email Urban Ladder. Please tell me all this is not true.  \"We do not recommend the Memory Foam Mattress for infants,\" a customer-care agent replies. \"Chemical wise it is definitely safe for babies. However, when it comes to the overall safety, the memory foam mattress may cause risk for suffocation for infants... (sic).\" By now, I am gobsmacked. is there no outrage about this? Why aren't murderous a thing? I turn to Twitter with these questions. I must know why India's fancy new mattress startups --Wakefit, Sleepy Cat, Sunday Mattresses, Wink & Nod --are hiding this potentially deadly secret.  As my rant on Twitter gathers steam (159 retweets at last count), the calls start to pour in. India's mattress entrepreneurs want to tell me I have got this all wrong. The real Pandora's Box lies elsewhere, and it hides much dirtier truths.   Calcium Carbonate & Other Secrets  First to call is IIT-Roorkee graduate Ankit the founder of Wakefit. Garg understands foam, having worked with the stuff at the German multinational Bayer Material Sciences.  He decided to start Wakefit in 2016 after a retailer demanded a hefty sum for a knew how much the raw material cost, I shocked,\" Garg says. \"The manufacturer doesn't make too much margin in this industry. The distributor and retailer do.  But the retailer brings no value addition. He has no training. He can't tell the customer what is good or bad is for his body type. And the customer has no idea what he is buying. It was clear to me that the industry was ripe for disruption.\"  Wakefit's sales have jumped from under Rs 2 crore in the first year (FY16) to Rs 27.6 crore in FY18, with a profit of Rs 2.23 crore. The startup is backed by Sequoia Capital.  \"Walk into a showroom of any traditional mattress company and you will see blue maroon and white,\" Garg says. \"And tonnes of permutations and combinations of foam, spring, latex, coir, bonded foam and expanded polyethylene (EPE) foam.  Every big brand out there has thousands of SKUs (stock keeping units).  Either they do not know how to make the perfect mattress or they are good at deceiving the customer.\"  He then adds a more damning charge. \"Just like food, foam too can be adulterated --with calcium carbonate powder. When calcium carbonate reacts with your sweat, it emits heat. That is why foam sometimes gets a bad rap for being 'hot' to sleep on. A retailer can give you discounts based on the filler content. Nobody has a clue. There are no standards.\"  Garg challenges every mattress brand to start disclosing the adulteration level in their foam. \"Let customers know what they are paying for.\"   Safe But Hard to Certify  A few weeks after my email, Urban Ladder's co-founder Rajiv Srivatsa texted me to say the company has finally added a warning on memory foam.  \"Honestly, I don't know why no one thought of this sooner. Maybe because the memory foam market is slightly more premium, we have seen that a lot of infants sleep in their own cribs,\" he says. \"The intent to do the right thing is always there. But it's just one of those things that don't strike you unless someone really thoughtful brings it up.\"  Unlike Siddiq and Garg, Srivatsa is less antsy about the traditional players. \"They have been around for many years and have a lot of customer feedback,\" he says. When I tell Siddiq about Urban Ladder's move --which could force the entire industry to change --he sounds miffed. Memory foam mattresses in India pose no threat whatsoever because they are firmer and have no sinking-in effect, he repeats.  So why not make this claim with scientific evidence and kill all doubts?  Because, well, there is just no way to do that. Multiple industry players tell me the same thing: Our products are 99.99% safe. But we cannot claim that because there is no way to get that kind of certification in India.  \"India is always slightly more backward, even in things like fire licensing or food safety,\" Siddiq argues. \"Customer education is very expensive. We are a young company; we will definitely do more as we grow.\"  The lack of scientific evidence also exposes the \"orthopaedic\" label that mattress brands flaunt as a mere marketing spiel.  Ashish Phadnis, an orthopaedic specialist at Jupiter Hospital in Thane, says it is just a way to signal authenticity. \"Unless you sleep with three pillows, with your arm under your head or some other awkward posture, using a mattress or a pillow can't cause any structural changes in your body,\" he says. \"Use whatever makes you comfortable.\"  Siddiq, meanwhile, is unrelenting in his takedown of the old guard. \"Traditional companies will call any product 'orthopaedic',\" he says. \"There is no way to verify the claim. It's like saying: 'This is a healthy drink' or 'a healthy food'. It's a huge market; consumers lack knowledge. When a customer calls us, we tell them clearly that our mattresses are not meant to eliminate back pain completely, but help in pressure relief.\"  Branding expert Srinivasan says companies must mind their messaging. \"Aside from huge legal risks, misleading claims or concealing safety hazards could create very big perception issues,\" he says.  Perception is everything. This business is really not about mattresses, you see. It's about selling you a dream: that you too can wake up every morning looking and feeling like those beautiful, happy people in the glossy mattress ads. \"This is 2019,\" Siddiq says. \"People really want to spend on better sleep.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">We do not want to be elitist in India: Dr Andreas Sennheiser, CEO,  Sennheiser Electronic</h1>", "description": "Unlike so many consumer brands today, the privately held and family-owned Sennheiser Electronic GmbH & Co is known only for audio -- primarily microphones & headphones for professional and consumer use. Co-CEO Dr Andreas Sennheiser , grandson of Fritz Sennheiser , spoke to ET about the German company\u2019s new products, successes and ambitions for India. Edited excerpts:    Tell us more about Sennheiser\u2019s India story.  Sennheiser has a tradition -- a legacy, if you will -- of being in markets very early, usually when they are not yet fully developed, because we believe that a premium brand needs to be present not only there when there is a lot of money to be earned but also to develop the market by itself. This is why we went to China 25 years ago and that is why we went to India 12 years ago (in 2007). Even in India, we had two different journeys. First was our consumer journey, where headphones were perceived as just a giveaway accessory with a phone. We built that category from scratch. Being there from the beginning is a strong reason why we have a premium positioning now. For the professional segment, Sennheiser products were reaching the market even before we officially set up shop. But it was the first time when we had our own crew on the ground plus the service plus all the installation support. So that was the beginning of being serious about building the audio infrastructure in India.   What is the biggest advantage and disadvantage of being a family-owned company?  A big advantage is that because of our independence, we are 100 per cent self-financed and that means we can really focus on what customers need. A good example of this is the first true wireless earbuds that we released in 2008. The market was just not ready. Not in India and not anywhere else in the world. But it [wireless earbuds] was invented by us at the time and we kept refining the technology. We have now launched the Momentum True Wireless earbuds when the market is ready.  About a disadvantage, from purely an investor's point of view, one could argue that new trends allow you to assimilate quick money. But then again, grabbing some of these trends can be unhealthy in the long run.   You and your brother Daniel took over as co-CEOs some years ago. Do you spar with your brother?  We have different perspectives on the business. I am an engineer; he is an industrial designer. So by nature, we were trained to look at things with different eyes. At the same time, we have a solid foundation of common beliefs: what we want, how to propel the company; how we want to serve our customers. It is possible we disagree or debate on a topic because we look at it from different viewpoints. But it can also lead to better solutions.   Does Sennheiser prefer contract manufacturing or own factories?  We do have four of our own manufacturing plants -- in Germany, Ireland, Romania and the US. But we also have strong manufacturing partners in China. We outsource certain steps to China. We do all the acoustically relevant components like the transducer while our China plant can do the final assembly and the packaging. The effort is to use the best supply chains to have a fair price point and maintain our centres of quality.   Last year, there was there was some talk of Sennheiser setting up an India manufacturing plant. Is that still on the cards?  We are always looking at how mature a market is and whether it makes sense to localise production. We do not feel like there is a short-term opportunity to manufacture here at the moment. That being said, we explore this option every two years. So it is still a possibility.   Headphones need to be heard before they are bought. How do you get around that obstacle while selling them if you do not have your own stores here?  Our share of online sales is increasing but we have a good footprint on the ground. With large format retail partners like Croma, customers have the opportunity to try out our headphones before buying. When it comes to online, we have a fair return policy in place with partners like Flipkart. If a customer feels he or she has misjudged something, it can be returned within 10 days.   Sennheiser\u2019s India catalogue includes a wide range of products, starting at Rs 600-700 and going all the way up to HE1 priced at Rs 45 lakh. Does such a wide price range dilute the brand?  This is something we extensively discussed. We are on a journey to premiumize our portfolio. The entry-level products you see in India are not available in many other countries. At the same time, because we are customer-oriented, we do not want to be elitist. Our goal is to offer the Sennheiser experience at all price points. As the buying power of a customer develops, he or she can upgrade to a higher quality and a higher price model.   Depending on whom the product is for, there is a perception that how it looks can be more important than how it sounds.  There was a time when the \u2018flashiness\u2019 of the product was rated higher than the quality. Since the past couple of years, we are seeing a higher importance being placed on sound quality. It is also important to have stable wireless connections and better integration with other ecosystems like iOS and Android. This change is just in the last three to five years -- a shift back to preference for higher quality products.   Which price bracket sees the bulk of sales in India?  We see the strongest growth in the upper categories, especially on the wireless side. Our portfolio has changed to include more wireless products -- about four times more wireless products this year than the same period last year.   Traditional audiophile logic has always claimed that wired connections are better than wireless. So how do tenets of audio quality and wireless connections reconcile with each other?  We can see that the younger group of audiophiles have no negative connotation with wireless. Technically speaking, we have been working hard to ensure our wireless connections offer the same level of transmission quality as a copper cable. But it is true that many still perceive it as being inferior.   Sennheiser makes a microphone for virtual reality (VR) applications, the Ambeo VR Mic. Why is this important and are there other companies making similar products?  The Ambeo ecosystem starts from the recording side -- through processing, mixing and playback. Currently, there is no other company that covers this full chain. We also do training on how to record immersive audio and provide the right software tools in the middle and the playback devices that allow you to enjoy appropriate ambient sound. The word Ambeo is a play on the word ambience (a 360-degree audio experience). We also see it as the next logical evolution after mono and stereo. Have you ever wondered how we can hear 3D sound despite having only two ears? It was only a matter of time till we found the sonic algorithms and knowhow to convert 3D sound to a binary signal.   Do you see augmented reality (AR) and VR as viable segments?  Absolutely. They are small right now but there is a big opportunity. We are seeing so many companies focused on visuals (getting the images and artificial worlds right). No one has focused on the audio so far, which gives us a chance to chip in with our solution for every AR and VR company. Even with AR and VR, sound gives you the cue about where to look. If something happens behind you in a 3D world and you do not get the appropriate sound from the appropriate direction, you might miss it. So think about products like Magic Leap, VR goggles, Oculus and Microsoft HoloLens. They all have the need for perfect audio in order to make their experience seamless.   Sennheiser seems to be getting into a new category. We heard about the Ambeo Soundbar -- a premium, 2,500 Euro one-piece speaker system with Dolby Atmos. Is there a market for this in India too?  Currently, we are focusing on the European and American markets. That does not mean it is not coming to more markets like India at a later stage. It\u2019s just a matter of sequencing. It is our first product in this category. Plus, it is not really a sound bar. We like to think of it like a multi-speaker system in the form factor of a sound bar. It projects sound from nine speakers into the room and there are speakers on the sides and the top in addition. When it comes to this product, it is common to see people turning their heads around, looking for speakers that just are not there. The idea is to give you a powerful multi-speaker installation without wiring.   How do you decide which products to launch in India and when?  India is a market where we learned a lot about adopting new technologies. For instance, for electronic news gathering and mobile journalism, India was faster than most of the Western or mature countries. Plus, users are smart and smartphone usage is on the rise. Our conclusion is that when it comes to mobile applications, India is a better market. For other products like the Soundbar, India may not be the first market we launch in.   How big is the professional market for Sennheiser? How do reach those consumers?  For professionals, we have two divisions. First is business communication. Our main partners are integrators, architects and system planners. We would like to showcase to end users how great it is to have a ceiling microphone installed in a boardroom and not bother about a mess of cables on the table. Next, for pro audio, our customers are sound designers, engineers, movie producers, artists on stage and so on. These are the people we work with because they share our passion of entertaining people. We stopped making aviation headsets a while ago. This was a tough decision to make. Being a pilot myself, it was tough to stop making something I used regularly. It was a necessary decision after many years of staying at a relatively small market share.   Sennheiser is nearly 75 years old. Did you have any missteps?  In 75 years of our company, we have been at the forefront in many categories. The first wireless microphone in 1958 came from Sennheiser. We made the first hi-fi headphones in 1968. These were both commercial successes. The first surround system also came from Sennheiser in the 80s. But it was a commercial failure because at the time, there was no content available. I mentioned this previously, but the first true wireless earphones were launched by us in 2008. They never did too well either.   Was price a reason for the failure of the first true wireless headphones?  Those were about $299, which is roughly the same price point as the product we have today. It was not about the price or the technology challenge but more about social acceptance. At the time, was it okay to walk around with individual earbuds in your ears? Ten years later, it is perfectly fine to walk around with earbuds.   Is there higher interest for Sennheiser from tier 1 or from tier II and III cities?  We started our efforts with tier I cities but we are also present and available in tier II & III thanks to the online market. For the pro segment, there are a lot of smaller installations. But for those, we rely on system integrators.   What is next for Sennheiser?  If you look at the three generations that have been in charge of running the company, we have had three focus points. My grandfather was the researcher and inventor. At the time, there was a market for everything he could think of and build. When my father took over, he took charge of expanding the company. And now, since my brother and I are in charge, we focus on collaborative aspects -- integration with other companies. By that I mean our headphones are connected to Google and Apple cloud services. Another example is Amazon. They have their own smart assistant now. We have to fully integrate with and co-develop with such companies, which is probably our task for the next decade.  The next generations of products will have smarter services built in. One example is simultaneous translation. You speak your language and I speak mine -- we just sit across the table from each other and have a conversation with everything being translated and fed into our ears in real time.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Why luxury hotels are making a beeline for temple towns</h1>", "description": "With the cricket world cup scheduled in June in England, one would expect hotelier Ankur Bhatia to be busy promoting his Roseate properties in London. But his focus right now is the luxury chain\u2019s latest domestic offering \u2014 The Roseate Ganges \u2014 a plush retreat on the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh. He is devoting special attention to the new property because its March launch was accompanied by the opening of two other competing properties in Rishikesh\u2014the Taj Rishikesh Resort and Spa and the Modi Yoga Retreat by BK Modi\u2019s Spice Group.  Luxury resorts cropping up in pilgrimage towns\u2014once associated with austerity and material and physical hardships\u2014is not limited to Rishikesh. As well-heeled travelers seek safety and comfort on their spiritual sojourns, luxury hotel chains have been quick to spot the demand.  Between 2019 and 2021, ITC Hotels plans on opening its WelcomHotel-branded properties in Amritsar and Katra, and Fortune-branded hotels in Ajmer and Shirdi and a WelcomHeritage Hotel in Prayagraj. Apart from existing properties in spiritual towns , Radisson Hotel Group\u2019s pipeline includes hotels in Amritsar, Katra and Nathdwara, with plans to expand in cities such as Madurai and Rameswaram over the next five years in line with their growth strategy for religious destinations. Sarovar Hotels, which already has a presence in Badrinath, Haridwar, Vrindavan and Tirupati, plans to open Portico-branded properties in Katra and Bodh Gaya this year and in Ajmer next year.  Indian Hotels Company (Taj Group), which has properties across its Taj, Vivanta, Gateway and Ginger brands in pilgrimage towns such as Varanasi, Amritsar, Madurai, Nashik, Ajmer and Katra, is opening a new property in Tirupati this financial year, and has also signed a property in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  The Lemon Tree Hotels group, a mid-priced segment player, has a property opening in Rishikesh soon, and will start properties in Neelkanth and Tapovan in Uttarakhand and Dwaraka in Gujarat and in 2020.  With domestic religious tourism seeing a sharp uptick, towns such as Shirdi, Tirupati, Varanasi, Mathura, Katra, Gaya, Amritsar and Ajmer are in the cross hairs of hotel groups that are vying for the best possible locations and local alliances.   High Spirits The rise in the numbers of spiritual tourists have been a function of rising affluence as well as massive recent strides in road, rail and air connectivity. Fast trains such as Rajdhani and Shatabdi have been introduced to these destinations; many new airports have been opened and luxury bus services on these routes have also become aplenty.  Central and state governments have also improved the infrastructure in and around religious sites. With religious trips being an integral part of the Indian family calendar, once the connectivity and infrastructure improved, premium hospitality was always going to be just one step behind.  Rajeev Kale, president and country head at Thomas Cook India, says that for India\u2019s new age travellers, spiritual tourism no longer evokes images of hardship and penance. \u201cOur consumer data reiterate strong and growing interest in luxury spiritual tourism\u2014an increase of 15-20% year on year. Well-heeled HNI-UHNI pilgrims are opting for spiritual locales with stays in luxury tents, deluxe spa-resorts, private helicopter tours and exclusive darshans and aartis, indulgent rejuvenation through Ayurveda, spa and yoga packages, fine dining and uber-luxe experiences,\u201d he says.  Dipak Haksar, chief executive, ITC Hotels and Welcomhotels, elaborates that religious sites are extremely popular in India and have created hubs of demand for luxury chains such as ITC. \u201cWith increased inflow of celebrities, businessmen, young professionals and international tourists to spiritual destinations, the demand for branded hotels has gone up significantly. Today\u2019s traveller expects quality accommodation along with full services at prices that are high on value,\u201d he says.   Never a Lull What hoteliers like about such destinations is also the lack of seasonality in demand. Spiritual destinations are in high demand almost around the year. \u201cDemand is never a question in these cities. Political situations have minimal bearing on visitors at these places. There is never a lull,\u201d says Ajay Bakaya, managing director, Sarovar Hotels and Resorts. With land available at reasonably lower costs as compared to major cities or tourist destinations and steady footfall, Bakaya reveals all the hotels needed to do was provide a decent stay option and focus extensively on making it easier for visitors to approach places of worship by liaising with locals and authorities.  It was one such family darshan that compelled Ankur Bhatia to fast-track The Roseate Ganges property. On one of his many religious visits to Rishikesh and Shirdi, he was firm in his resolve that these destinations needed luxurious stay options as well. \u201cRishikesh is a big travel destination. It attracts Indian and international celebrities and luxury travellers as well. Our idea was to allow people to do yoga by the ganges, attend Ganga aarti with a specialist, have a local curate the entire darshan for guests and then unwind over great food and spa offerings at a \u20185-star\u2019 ashram,\u201d he elaborates. And even before it opened, his resort was pre-booked till June.   Experiences Galore Airbnb data for 2018 shows religious destinations seeing a phenomenal growth with almost 150% growth in guest arrivals in Tirupati, 90% in Amritsar and 79% in Haridwar over last year.  Amanpreet Bajaj, country manager, Airbnb, is also noticing an increased draw towards experiences on Airbnb in places like Varanasi where the host takes you through the lanes, bazaars and ghats or tours in Chennai showcasing the beautiful architecture of southern temples.  Packages that combine the majesty of environment with the bliss of spirituality is also popular with premium travellers, says Thomas Cook's Kale. Luxury packages in this category are popular with corporate honchos, industrialists and celebrities. \"There are unique programmes of spirituality and private jeep safaris through wildlife sanctuaries. Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain Omkareshwar combined with Kanha, Bandhavgarh and Panna; Gujarat's Dwarka and Somnath/Nageshwar Jyotirling coupled with Gir/Rann of Kutch and Uttaranchal's Chardham in tandem with Corbett and Rajaji National Park,\" he says.

But he added the company has a \u201cgreat track record of resolving issues\u201d and that its growth strategy remains unchanged.  \u201cWe all know, that in any strong and well-managed company there will always be differences,\u201d said Dutta.  \u201cAnd, yes, there may be differences currently on certain matters but the company has a great track record of resolving issues and coming out ahead. If the current differences were to not get resolved, you shall certainly hear about it; however, it serves no purpose speculating about it,\u201d he added without elaborating.  ET reported May 16 on a serious rift between the airline\u2019s founders Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal , which, if not addressed, would hamper the working of the airline.  Sources have said the differences stem from multiple reasons including a shareholders agreement skewed heavily in favout of Bhatia as well as differences in their respective visions for the future of the airline.  The agreement, which expires in October, gives Bhatia\u2019s holding company InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) the right to appoint the chairman and key managerial personnel, including the managing director, chief executive officer and president of the company. It also has the right to nominate three non-independent directors, one of whom will be non-retiring.  In the statement, Dutta cited Gangwal as saying that the RG Group which represents his and his family\u2019s holding has \u201cno interest or desire\u201d to take control of the company or to renegotiate the shareholders\u2019 agreement.  The RG Group on the other hand, has the right to nominate just one non-independent director, who will be a non-retiring director.There have been differences on the appointment of senior executives.  Dutta said IndiGo has gone through a continuum of management changes and that \u201ca little bit of turbulence during these transition phases is neither unusual nor unwelcome,\u201d  He said the promoters and the board have \u201cworked as a team in making the management changes\u201d and that not every management change should be seen as a sign of \u201cdissonance\u201d at the top.  Dutta acknowledged that Bhatia is represented by the law firm J Sagar Associates and Gangwal by Khaitan & Co. But he added that have been on retainer by the founders since IndiGo\u2019s IPO in 2015.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">How Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi knit the biggest revival story of India\u2019s apparel export industry</h1>", "description": "In December 2017, Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi was in Dubai for a short Christmas holiday with his family. It had been planned months ago. Else he would have avoided taking a break just two months after taking a job as managing director at Gokaldas Exports .  But this was in some ways worse \u2014 now he was on vacation, and yet his mind was preoccupied. After two decades at the Aditya Birla Group, it took a lot of deliberation to quit as chief operating officer at Idea Cellular and move to lead Gokaldas, heeding the call of his friend and IIM-Bangalore classmate Mathew Cyriac, a one-time PE executive who now owned a significant chunk of the publicly traded garment exporter.  Gokaldas was weighed down not just by the structural challenges in India\u2019s apparel export industry \u2014 low margins, a fluctuating rupee and competition from countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 but also its own chequered past.     The company was among the earliest India targets for Blackstone, one of the world\u2019s largest investment firms, led by the influential American executive Stephen A Schwarzman. By virtue of its scale, Blackstone\u2019s investments and their performance are closely watched for signals about sectors and countries.  In 2007, the bulge bracket investor put in Rs 482.50 crore for a 50.1% stake, which at Rs 275 a share represented a 20% premium to the prevailing share price. It then acquired another 20% through an open offer. Over the next decade, however, the company stagnated, its dollar revenues halved, and its share price was hammered down to double digits.  Blackstone tried to sell the company, and slowly offloaded its stake. In early 2017, after having spent a decade at Blackstone, Mathew Cyriac quit as co-head of the firm\u2019s private equity business in India to start his own fund. It was when he went to the company\u2019s New York offices to say his goodbyes that the firm offered Gokaldas to Cyriac. When his Florintree Capital bought Blackstone\u2019s stake at Rs 42 a share \u2014 through special purpose vehicle Clear Wealth Consultancy Services LLP \u2014 the deal represented an 84% write-down on the latter\u2019s original investment.        First order of business was hiring a CEO, and the second, backing them up with necessary capital. \u201cWhen I looked around, most apparel exports companies were led by their owners. I decided I needed to find a CEO who would think like an owner,\u201d Cyriac says.  Ganapathi\u2019s mandate was to turn around the company, once India\u2019s largest apparel exporter. He visited the company\u2019s Bengaluru factory four times before he signed on. He also held discussions with the company\u2019s chairman, Richard Saldanha, who told him that the company was not in the business of apparel, but in the business of trust.      Companies such as Gokaldas make their money by supplying garments to the world\u2019s leading fashion retailers. Think Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Zara and so on. These brands are not just paranoid about quality, they need to be able to trust a supplier to not deviate from specifications across tens of thousands of units. Nurturing relationships, calming frayed nerves, offering the flexibility to quickly turn around unscheduled but urgent orders \u2014 these are all as much part of the business as producing high-quality garments.  Cyriac says he also felt a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to set the story right, as someone who had been part of Blackstone\u2019s India journey right through. (He was not involved in managing Gokaldas while he worked at the investing firm). There were 25,000 employees who were counting on the company\u2019s turnaround.     Big players such as Arvind Lifestyle were entering the field. Gokaldas had slipped to the seventh position on the export turnover league table. The top player, Shahi Exports, posted seven times as much revenue as Gokaldas, whose top line had stagnated at about Rs 1,000 crore for a decade. Things were not looking good.     Once he was in the driver\u2019s seat, Ganapathi lost no time in donning the battle gear. On the morning of December 29, 2017, he took a break from his Dubai vacation and got into a video-conference, while the rest of the Gokaldas board joined from Bengaluru.  His primary focus was to get approval to raise around Rs 125 crore. That was the easy part. It would take five more months for the company to raise Rs 70 crore through qualified institutional placements. The money came from L&T Mutual Fund and HSF Mauritius, an overseas fund.  With the money in the bag, Ganapathi turned his focus on customers and efficiency. Around a year later, his plan seems to be working. After recording losses of Rs 46 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 28 crore in 2017-18, Gokaldas has recorded a net profit of Rs 25.58 crore for 2018-19. All the four quarters were in the black despite the apparel exports industry facing steady headwinds. The shares of the company closed at Rs 76 at the end of trading on Friday, May 17.  The challenge now is to maintain the gains and take the company higher up in the exports league table. So what did Ganapathi change?     Richard Saldanha, chairman of Gokaldas Exports and a former vice-chairman at Blackstone, says the basic change has been \u201chow the company goes to market\u201d \u2014 how it interacts and sells its services to its clients.  Saldanha had joined the Gokaldas Exports board in 2011 after the exit of the erstwhile promoters, the Bengaluru based Hinduja brothers \u2014 Madanlal, Rajendra and Dinesh (unrelated to the UK based Hinduja group).  It was unusual for a private equity investor to let the erstwhile promoters run the business for three years after a buyout. After the trio left, the company saw two more CEOs \u2014 Gautam Chakraborty and P Ramababu \u2014 come and go. But sustainable performance eluded it. Meanwhile, the rupee to dollar rate that was around Rs 39 in 2007-08 was flirting with Rs 70 in 2017.  Earlier, says Saldanha, Gokaldas would go to customers only to take orders. One of the first things Ganapathi did after taking over as CEO was to visit all his major customers across the world \u2014 the list includes the likes of Nike, Adidas, GAP and Marks & Spencer.  Ganapathi says: \u201cI met all the customers one by one, explained to them that we are seriously committed to the relationship and we will expand our capacities.\u201d Next, Ganapathi focused on increasing capacity. \u201cThe company has been shrinking and giving up on capacity. I thought let me push it.\u201d     He found assembly lines lying idle in warehouses and decided to revive them. This alone led to a 10% increase in capacity. Another move was operational efficiency. He pushed the same assembly line that made 1,000 garments in a given time to make 1,100, he says.  \u201cWe tried to engineer the assembly lines better.\u201d Ganapathi says a garment-making assembly line is not a smoothly moving chain. A particular stitch may take 33 seconds while the next one may take 38 seconds, and bottlenecks develop at these points.  \u201cWe redeployed the most efficient workers to the parts of the assembly line that took more time.\u201d Automation was brought in to expedite work. \u201cWe reduced the time taken to make a shirt from 21 minutes to 19 minutes,\u201d Ganapathi adds.  Margins soon improved and working capital needs dropped from 120 days to 100 days. The last and key part of the turnaround process was to inject funds and invest in new, modernised processes. The fund infusion happened in May 2018. The company invested Rs 36 crore in improving its plants, processes and information systems, and also acquired seven new customers. Ganapathi points out that for over a decade no equity had flowed into the company, as the buyout deals were between promoters.  Cyriac says he sees a \u201cbig opportunity\u201d in the industry. \u201cWe see a chance to treble the company\u2019s turnover in double quick-time and opportunities to acquire many distressed assets,\u201d says Cyriac. He also sees an opportunity to build an apparel-making platform around Gokaldas Exports.  Independent analysts are not quite as optimistic. \u201cIndia\u2019s apparel exports are estimated to de-grow by 4-5% in FY2019, following a similar de-growth of 4% in FY2018,\u201d credit rating agency ICRA said in a February report. The report added a bottom was near and it expected a positive movement soon. However, it also pointed out that Indian players have not been able to make anything out of overall growth in the global trade in apparel.  China has been continuously losing market share, which has been pocketed by Bangladesh and Vietnam. The report pointed out the new emerging free-trade agreements such as the 11-nation trans-Pacific partnership and the proposed European Union-Vietnam foreign trade agreement would be detrimental for Indian exporters. These would give exporters from nations with zero or very low tariffs access to the Indian market. There are domestic challenges, too, says Ganapathi.  Despite all the homework he did before joining, he was not ready for the sudden developments \u2014 for example, the rupee strengthening in the last few months of 2017, the impact of the goods and services tax regime on exports or the credit squeeze on banks. Other structural changes can help Gokaldas.  Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said in a December 2018 report that as global customers set up shop in India, now 20% of Gokaldas\u2019 revenues would come from the domestic market. The report, by Shailee Parekh and Charmi Mehta, said: \u201cWe expect Gokaldas Exports to grow revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.3% in 2017-18 to 2020-21, taking the overall turnover to over Rs 1,700 crore in 2020-21.\u201d  It also predicted a sharp growth in its gross margin from 48% now to 53% by 2021. This would be music to the ears of investors such as L&T and HSF Mauritius who invested in Gokaldas last year, and can push the company up to among the top three among Indian apparel exporters. The market capitalisation of Gokaldas Exports has been stagnant at Rs 300-400 crore for over a decade.  By continuing to win the trust of customers, the company might eventually win the trust of the stock markets, too.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Tata faces $14 billion in auto debt and a slowdown in China</h1>", "description": "by P R Sanjai and Bruce Einhorn   Signs of a turnaround at its marquee Jaguar Land Rover unit may not be enough to ease the challenges facing India\u2019s oldest and most-storied business empire.  The Tata Group bought the British luxury carmaker in 2008 for $2.3 billion, and it\u2019s lately become a drag on the salt-to-software conglomerate, racking up losses in three quarters through December. Although Jaguar posted a net income of 119 million pounds ($151 million) this week, debt at owner Tata Motors Ltd. has grown to almost $14 billion, as it struggles to tide over a demand slump in China , the world\u2019s biggest auto market.  JLR\u2019s mixed fortunes have hit Tata -- whose wider group debt load bloated to at least $36 billion, the largest among India\u2019s conglomerates -- just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. Making matters worse, a steel deal in Europe that would\u2019ve eased the group\u2019s liabilities unraveled this month. Tata Motors and Tata Steel Ltd. had a combined debt of about $27 billion, accounting for more than half of the total dues owed by the group\u2019s top 18 units. This excludes debt of $9 billion till March 2018 for Tata Steel Bsl Ltd. and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd, which are in the process of restructuring.  \u201cTata will have to take harsh decisions to mitigate the risk of debt in the long term for the conglomerate,\u201d said Arun Kejriwal, a director at KRIS, a Mumbai-based investment advisory firm. \u201cFor now, Tata Motors and Tata Steel are trouble spots.\u201d    The twin developments mark the biggest challenge facing the 151-year-old group that ventured overseas with acquisitions more than a decade ago. Debt has become a defining issue for some of India\u2019s biggest companies as the government cracks down on bad loans following a decade of expansion.  Tata snapped up JLR from Ford Motor Co., and steelmaker Corus Group Plc in 2007 for $12.9 billion in one of the biggest purchases by an Indian company, shedding the group\u2019s once-staid image.  After years serving as a cash cow, JLR hit a bump in Europe amid concerns over a disruptive Brexit and the industry\u2019s shift away from fossil-fuel vehicles. The diminishing cash flows have raised questions as to how long Tata will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. The steel business was slammed by the financial crisis in 2008 and a commodity crisis eight years later, prompting the group to look for ways to dispose of the assets.  Tata Motors isn\u2019t looking to sell its luxury-car unit and expects a turnaround in China in the coming months, the automotive group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji told reporters on May 20. The profit in the fourth quarter came after JLR announced 4,500 job cuts globally and a 2.5 billion-pound savings program. Shares of the parent fell 7% in Mumbai on Tuesday, the most since May 15.   What Bloomberg Opinion Says  Rather than generating gains from dramatic cost cuts and other measures to boost the bottom line, its meager earnings came on the back of spending less on non-core manufacturing and working-capital improvements.-- Anjani Trivedi, columnist  Tata\u2019s struggles echo some of those faced by other Indian conglomerates, including tycoon Anil Ambani\u2019s group, which relied on high leverage to expand operations, only to see their business hit following a crackdown on bad loans by India\u2019s government.  Highlighting concerns over rising debt, S&P Global Ratings cut the credit rating of Tata Motors\u2019s long-term debt four times since July to B+, four notches below investment grade.  \u201cWe do not anticipate any more issues on debt,\u201d CFO Balaji told reporters Monday. \u201cWe do not have any plans to raise funds for JLR to tide over the current debt.\u201d  One problem is the small volume of JLR sales in China compared to the competition. In the first four months of 2019, JLR sold only 8,900 Jaguars and 20,400 Land Rovers, down from 15,100 Jaguars and 39,800 Land Rovers a year earlier, according to data collected by Bloomberg Intelligence.  That puts the Indian automaker at a significant disadvantage against luxury rivals that have much bigger scale in China, said S&P analyst Ashutosh Sharma. In April, for instance, BMW and Mercedes-Benz both sold more than 58,000 vehicles.  \u201cGiven their size, JLR is unable to match the price competition ensuing in China,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThey are not trying to get into price competition, so they are facing steep volume declines.\u201d The rating agency expects cash flow for Tata Motors will remain negative until at least next March.   Quality Perceptions  Even in its home market in the U.K., the automaker struggles with the perception of poorly made cars. In the 2018 reliability ranking published by What Car?, JLR had four of the five worst performers among the 25 large and luxury SUVs surveyed.  The headwinds faced by JLR will also test the mettle of Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, a 30-year veteran insider brought in two years ago to revamp the $110-billion group and fix faltering units. Patriarch and long-time chairman Ratan Tata handpicked him to succeed Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted in October 2016 from the top job following a board feud. The goal of the restructuring is to eventually whittle down the 100 operating companies to a more-manageable number under 10 verticals.  The bad news from JLR was compounded by Tata Steel\u2019s decision to give up on a proposed joint venture with German rival, Thyssenkrupp AG, amid antitrust concerns. The deal would\u2019ve helped transfer some of its debt to the joint venture, allowing the Mumbai-based company to sharpen its focus on ramping up its profitable Indian business. The group is still looking for a partner, possibly outside Europe, an executive said in an interview last week.  As part of his restructuring plan, Chandrasekaran achieved a breakthrough last week. Tata Global Beverages Ltd., which owns brands such as Tetley tea and Eight O\u2019Clock coffee, announced plans to acquire the spice, salt and lentil brands of Tata Chemicals Ltd. The newly-enlarged food company will take on a new name, Tata Consumer Products Ltd., and will have sales of nearly 91 billion rupees ($1.3 billion).  \u201cTata Sons is simplifying businesses and such moves will unlock Tata Global Beverages\u2019s valuations,\u201d said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai.  However, a fix for Tata Steel\u2019s European business and its 2.2 billion euros in debt is still on Chandrasekaran\u2019s to-do list. He\u2019s exploring strategic options, including a potential stake sale, Bloomberg News reported in March.  Recent channel checks in China indicated \u201cprogress on ground has been slow, with dealers still incurring losses on JLR sales,\u201d Jefferies analyst Arya Sen wrote Monday.   Tata Group clarification: \u201cThe Tata Motors group is a Rs 3,00,000Cr international automotive conglomerate with a Networth of Rs 60,000 Cr that generates an EBITDA of Rs 27,000Cr. Its automotive business has a net debt of Rs 28,000Cr. Out of this JLR is Rs 6,500Cr (Net Debt / EBITDA of 0.4) and Tata Motors domestic business is 15,500Cr (Net Debt / EBITDA of 2.7).  Additionally, we have Tata Motors Finance, an NBFC that finances commercial and passenger vehicles. This has a net debt of 38000cr to finance commercial and passenger vehicles with Net NPAs of 1.4% generating 12% ROE.  Our business is well capitalised with Consolidated Net Automotive Debt to Equity of 0.47. The maturities of our debt is well spread out right till 2027. Additionally, we have Rs 19,000Cr of undrawn revolving credit facilities. The business generates operating cash flows after interest of Rs 21500Cr.  The figures quoted in the article pertain to gross debt numbers which gives a misleading picture. As reported by all global auto industry firms, this needs to be seen as Net Automotive Debt (Gross debt less cash on hand without considering the financing arm) which, as can be seen from the above analysis, is at comfortable levels.\u201d   ", "published_date": "May 22, 2019, 10.05 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:51:54", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/tata-faces-14-billion-in-auto-debt-and-a-slowdown-in-china/articleshow/69438077.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal\u2019s order on Friday came on a plea by IDBI Bank , a lender to Jaypee Infratech , seeking a stay or annulment of the voting process. A three-member bench asked the financial creditors to conduct fresh voting from May 31.  IDBI Bank had opposed the state-run building company\u2019s bid for debt-hit Jaypee Infratech, terming it a conditional offer. The bench also allowed the company\u2019s committee of creditors (CoC) to renegotiate the offer with the sole bidder, NBCC.  On Thursday, buyers of homes in Jaypee Infratech\u2019s projects and its financial creditors started voting on NBCC's proposal to acquire the company under the insolvency resolution process. The voting was to end on Sunday and the outcome declared the following day.  According to Friday\u2019s NCLAT order, the CoC may approve the plan if it is in accordance with law. But, if the vote is to reject the bid, the committee must wait for the appellate tribunal\u2019s clearance before passing the decision.  The NCLAT also allowed nine homebuyers\u2019 associations to file intervention applications.

(IHCL) and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC will set up a three-year, Rs 4,000-crore investment platform to acquire hotels in the luxury, upper-upscale and upscale segments, the company said on Friday.  The Tata group company that runs the Taj hotels said the partnership will enable it to pursue acquisitions in an \u201casset-light format,\u201d favouring management contracts over complete property ownership. Under the deal, equity contribution from IHCL will be 30% with the rest to be contributed by GIC over three years.  CEO Puneet Chhatwal told ET that potential acquisitions by the platform include external assets and IHCL properties that it wants to sell stakes in.  \u201cI think we are looking at assets that go into NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal), assets which are distressed, and are being sold at a value that is compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, this would also include assets we own because it is a part of our strategy.\u201d The NCLT benches function as bankruptcy courts.   Asset-light Strategy  Chhatwal said this was in line with the company\u2019s plan to dispose of assets.  \u201cWe had said we don\u2019t want to be asset heavy anymore. We sold apartments, our properties in Thiruvananthapuram and Vishakhapatnam,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be assets in our system which are owned 100% by us. So, our shareholding goes from 100% in these assets to 30% of the equity then.\u201d  The partners will look for acquisitions in India\u2019s top 10 cities besides state capitals, Chhatwal said \u201cThere are some state capitals which are very important and commercial cities. A city like Bhopal and those like Indore or Pune are also not bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be opportunity driven. So, if the opportunity is big and it is a good one, we will go for it.\u201d  The mandate will be to acquire fully operational hotels with each purchase being made through a special purpose vehicle with its own funding. The acquired hotels will be managed by IHCL under its various brands. GIC was keen to partner with IHCL to build a quality hospitality portfolio in key destinations across India, said Kok Sun Lee, chief investment officer of GIC Real Estate.  \u201cAs a long-term investor, we are confident in the outlook of India\u2019s hospitality sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to working closely with established partners such as IHCL to pursue attractive opportunities and capture the sector\u2019s growth potential.\u201d  IHCL said it would sell noncore assets and become less ownership driven as part of its Aspiration 2022 strategy, which was announced in February last year. As much as 60% of the properties it runs will not be owned by the company by 2022. IHCL also wants to reduce its dependence on the luxury segment and move hotels belonging to group entities to the holding company. The strategy also calls for monetising noncore assets, including residential apartments in Mumbai and elsewhere, besides forging new alliances with other Tata group companies.  The company has been on an aggressive management contract signing spree under Chhatwal, adding 22 hotels with an inventory of over 3,200 rooms across brands in India and key international markets such as London, Makkah, Kathmandu and Dubai in the year ended March.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Daiichi Sankyo vs Singh Brothers: How a diary note made the difference</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: A daily journal maintained by a top executive helped the Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo win a high-stakes court battle. In 2016, Daiichi Sankyo secured a favourable decision from a Singapore arbitration court against Ranbaxy scions Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh. Daiichi had pressed charges of concealing data and information prior to and following the signing of a record deal to acquire Ranbaxy in 2008. The court ordered Singh Brother to pay up $500 million to Daiichi. India's Supreme Court backed the order.  The revelation of the \"journal\" is part of a controversial book Bottle of Lies authored by investigative journalist Katherine Eban and released recently.  Tsutomu Une, a senior management representative at Daiichi Sankyo, maintained the journal that was presented as Exhibit A in its case againt the Singh brothers .  Une's notes help establish that the Ranbaxy promoters had for a long time deliberately concealed information of data fabrication related to a number of products granted approvals in the US. Une had played a pivotal role in steering negotiations for the $4.6 billion majority-stake buyout. While Daiichi Sankyo had faced growth challenges, Ranbaxy presented as a good target to what it had then called a \"hybrid model\" and expand presence in scores of emerging markets.  But Une could not be faulted for the deal imploding as he was kept in the dark on the nature of the USFDA's comprehensive probe. Eban's book, in a chapter titled \"You just don't get it\", notes:  He (Une) felt driven by the need to make his company whole for the disastrous purchase he'd championed. Within three years (after the deal), Une's carefully written journal would become Exhibit A when Une and a team of lawyers brought their claim of Malvinder's deception\u2026.  The information on the false submissions for product approvals was part of a slide deck titled \"Self-Assessment Report\" or SAR to the Ranbaxy board by the then R&D head Rajinder Kumar. The board did not escalate the issues with the USFDA despite the advice of company lawyers.  The book describes Une as \"gentlemanly and formal\". He noted crucial details in his journal, mostly expressing doubt and confusion about the way the issues were communicated to him by Malvinder Singh and his deputies in the wake of the USFDA investigations.   Eban extracts from one such anecdote in Une's journal:  As Malvinder continued to play dumb, Une was left with a Delphic riddle of sorts. Why would the FDA deem the entire company dishonest if, as Malvinder claimed, Ranbaxy had done everything right? All Une could do was parse the clues in front of him. He was a careful observer and wrote in his journal about his meetings with Malvinder and his deputies. \"What I found out is that they also do not understand the reason AIP was invoked (Application Integrity Policy was invoked - AIP is an extremely strong step by the US FDA to investigate product approval filings). They are not aware that the entire system was deemed suspicious even though it was partially fixed. Malav-San joined [the meeting] at the end. Member's tone changes. They are very much afraid of him.  In another similar reference, Une appeared to have counseled himself for patience in not being able to comprehend anything the FDA probe as he noted: Malav-San's response to requests in connection with the FDA is slow. I understand that it is in the middle of the most celebrated festival but\u2026Patience.  The Japanese executive finally learnt about parallel investigations by the US Justice department from Warren Hamel of Venable LLP, a lawyer appointed by Ranbaxy.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">FMCG cracks the Patanjali code, naturally</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Patanjali Ayurved disrupted the Indian fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) sector with nature-based products in various categories to challenge the dominance of companies such as Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) in the past three-four years.  That has forced rivals, especially the multinationals, to retool their portfolios to introduce matching products at similar price points to try and regain their market ranking, analysts said. This seems to be paying off, they said.  The homegrown upstart has been most successful in staples such as ghee, flour, ayurvedic health supplements, toothpaste, edible oil and condiments but less so in noodles, biscuits, personal care, chocolates and juices.  Its rapid growth posed a threat to mainstream FMCG companies by renewing the natural/herbal/ayurvedic theme and compelling FMCG companies to tweak their range. For instance, HUL\u2019s personal care products faced headwinds, prompting the company to relaunch its Ayush brand and acquire ayurvedic hair oil brand Indulekha. Having sustained similar damage in the oral care segment, Colgate-Palmolive launched its own herbal toothpaste.     The Patanjali effect on Colgate-Palmolive is waning, possibly due to distribution and supply chain issues apart from the fading novelty of its products, according to JPMorgan\u2019s report this month on the FMCG sector by Latika Chopra and Sushruta Mishra.  While hurting FMCG companies in the short term, Patanjali predominantly gained market share in commoditised categories made up of unorganised players.   \u2018COMPANY CAN TROUBLE UNORGANISED PLAYERS\u2019  Competitive intensity has faded in the organised end since Patanjali\u2019s products no longer have the unique selling proposition (USP) of being natural with other brands having entered the market at similar or lower price points, experts said.  \u201cThe threat has receded but it is more of a case of Patanjali having lost the plot,\u201d said Milind Sarwate, former CFO of Marico and now an independent director on several boards. \u201cThey tried too many things. They have not looked at their growing in scale at the back end. They succeeded in demand creation but not in demand fulfilment. They fell short of the institutional strength to sustain the rising volume. Their threat is definitely lower because they had internal issues \u2014 supply not being on time, trade not happy with them.\u201d  Patanjali is diversifying into new categories such as garments and education. It\u2019s also in the fray to acquire Ruchi Soya, a large player in the commoditised industry of solvent extraction or edible oils.  Analysts say that the company is likely to pose more of a threat to the unorganised sector going forward.  \u201cEven if Patanjali is able to overcome its recent issues on quality and supply chain, we expect it to gain market share in these commoditised categories at the expense of unorganised players, and not pose a major threat to the listed F&B companies playing in non-commoditised categories,\u201d said the food and beverage report released by Systematix Investments earlier this month. Still, Patanjali retains the ability to create further disruption, said Sarwate.  \u201cPatanjali cannot be ignored by the market leaders \u2014 they are capable of a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect them to do something dramatic like giving 30% discount on their products or so.\u201d  The JPMorgan report says there is a downside risk for Dabur\u2019s growth prospects due to the overlap of categories with Patanjali such as chyawanprash, honey, hair oil and toothpaste.  Based on ETIG data, Nestle and Britannia have outperformed on the ground as well as on the bourses, despite competition from Patanjali. Dabur also has managed to keep improving its performance amid competitive intensity.  HUL\u2019s market share in soaps has been resilient even after the entry of Patanjali, according to the latest report by Reliance Securities.

The conglomerate will transfer the branded salt, pulses, masalas and ready-to-eat snacks portfolio from Tata Chemicals to Tata Global Beverages as part of its strategy to simplify corporate structure and consolidate operations in similar lines of businesses.  The proposal, which is likely to be announced on Wednesday, will see the rechristening of Tata Global Beverages, reflecting the changing profile of its portfolio, said a person familiar with the matter. EY is assisting the enterprise in the consumer products-consolidation exercise.  Tata Chemicals CEO R Mukundan and Tata Global CEO Ajoy Misra didn\u2019t respond to TOI\u2019s calls.  The branded consumer products of Tata Chemicals \u2014 Tata Salt and Tata Sampann, among others \u2014 contributed 16% (or Rs 1,847 crore) and 19% (Rs 314 crore) to the company\u2019s total revenues of Rs 11,296 crore and operating profit of Rs 1,643 crore respectively in fiscal 2019. However, since salt is manufactured from the same complex (Mithapur in Gujarat) that also makes chemicals like soda ash, Tata Chemicals will be retaining the manufacturing operations.  The deal will increase Tata Global\u2019s revenues. In fiscal 2019, it reported consolidated revenues of Rs 7,252 crore.  Chandrasekaran had earlier brought the defence and aerospace business, spread across at least a dozen different companies, under a single umbrella. The chairman also plans to merge Tata Coffee with Tata Global, best known as the owner of Tetley tea.  Tata Chemicals, after the spin-off, will focus on chemicals and specialty products. There is a plan to merge Rallis, which is into crop-care products, with Tata Chemicals. The company launched Tata Salt in 1983, which today is the market leader.

Tata Global Beverages is expected to house the consumer products such as branded edible salt, pulses and spices owned by Tata Chemicals.  This is part of the strategy initiated by Tata Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran to reduce overlap between group companies and consolidate businesses sharing similar synergies and adjacencies within the conglomerate. The impending reorganisation will also result in the rechristening of Tata Global Beverages to a more suitable name to reflect the induction of the new names.  The modalities of the merger have been long drawn out in the group\u2019s foods and beverages businesses, and ET had first reported on September 3, 2018. \u201cThere are no final plans yet. Building a single consumer vertical is the biggest challenge compared to other verticals,\u201d a TGBL executive had told ET in September, last year.  \u201cTata Global Beverages\u2019 ambitious growth plans require us to operate with greater efficiency, reduce our cost base and fully tap the potential synergies across our businesses that operating on a global scale can bring us. There is also a significant opportunity to better leverage technology in service delivery,\" the TGBL spokesperson had then said in response to ET's query.  TGBL has been working towards an organisational structure and moving more activities to India in terms of back office and technology-related work. The Indian market contributes 45% to the company's business.  The move to consolidate the consumer goods businesses of Tata Chemicals with Tata Global is expected to free the company\u2019s business managers to focus on core activities, bring in agility and spur faster decision-making, as it seeks to become one of the largest FMCG companies in India with a possible merger with group firm Tata Chemicals.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">IndiGo, rivals spar over Jet\u2019s global slots</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The formula for distributing the foreign flying rights of the grounded Jet Airways has led to a schism in the airline industry, with IndiGo on one side and its rivals on the other, government officials told ET. State-owned Air India has first right of refusal \u2014 and will get about half of them on high-demand routes \u2014 and the remaining entitlements are given out in proportion to a carrier\u2019s domestic flights, which would give IndiGo the most, since it\u2019s market leader.  SpiceJet, Vistara and GoAir objected to this at a meeting convened by aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola on the grounds that this would create a \u201cmonopoly,\u201d said one of the persons cited above.  The airline promoter who recorded his opposition didn\u2019t name the carrier, the sources said. The rights are to be apportioned in accordance with the Aeronautical Information Circular or AIC, which gives Air India first claim on the entitlements.  Rule Followed for Allotment Red-flagged  After Air India, foreign flying rights will be alloted to airlines ranked in order of domestic flights measured in ASKs or available seat kilometres.  \u201cWhile the decision on the award of foreign flying rights of Jet Airways temporarily to other carriers has been taken, the opposition by airlines to the AIC is being discussed,\u201d said an aviation ministry official, who didn\u2019t want to be identified.  Air India\u2019s share has been decided. It will get about 5,700 weekly seats on the India-Dubai route, over 5,000 on the India-Qatar route besides about 4,600 additional seats to and from London. This is about half of Jet\u2019s quota on routes with high demand, said an airline executive.  \u201cThis is a temporary allocation,\u201d said a SpiceJet spokesperson. \u201cThe objective is to immediately provide flights for passengers who are paying high fares, mostly to foreign airlines. This objective will be fulfilled by those airlines that can provide immediate capacity and who have slots at both origin and destination. The rule referred to was made in 2005 with the objective of protecting the incumbent carriers at that time, primarily Air India. The rule is not relevant to the temporary allocation that is being done at this time. The ministry has already ignored this rule by allotting some of Jet\u2019s traffic rights to Air India on a temporary basis.\u201d  IndiGo, Vistara and GoAir didn\u2019t respond to queries.  Airline sources said most of the remaining allocation would go to IndiGo as it\u2019s the largest airline in the domestic sector.  One executive said this would be unfair. \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation, as a large number quota has been made available on busy international routes and should be evenly awarded to airlines, including the new ones, which have just announced the launch of international services,\u201d said the senior airline executive.  Another suggested that since the allocations are supposed to be temporary and with an intent of minimising inconvenience to the travelling public, pending Jet\u2019s possible revival, the government should allocate it to carriers that already operate on those routes.  However, this would mean that new airlines like Vistara and AirAsia India would be deprived of extra flying rights as they launch their international operations. It should be noted that, apart from Air India, Indian carriers mostly only fly to nearby overseas destinations, although IndiGo flies as far as Istanbul.  Separately, AirAsia India has protested against the aviation ministry\u2019s decision not to invite the carrier for meetings on the award of Jet Airways\u2019 foreign flying rights. It also reiterated its demand for rights to operate flights to various destinations in Southeast Asia, among others. The airline has applied for permission to fly overseas and is expecting approvals soon as it completes five years of domestic operations in June next year.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">YC Deveshwar, the man who transformed ITC into a multi-business conglomerate, passes away</h1>", "description": "Yogesh Chander Deveshwar, who has died aged 72, was a rare example of an employee joining straight out of college and moving through the ranks to become not just the youngest chairman of a frontline conglomerate in India Inc, but also the longest serving one for 23 years. So much so, Deveshwar and ITC Ltd had become synonymous with each other till he breathed his last on Saturday morning.  YCD, as he was popularly referred to in corporate circles, had joined the board of ITC Ltd in 1984 in just sixteen years after he joined the company from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. He was subsequently appointed the chief executive and chairman in 1996.  Along the way, Deveshwar was instrumental in transforming the Kolkata-based company from being mostly a cigarette maker to a conglomerate with interests in sectors such as fast-moving consumer goods, hotels, paper and packaging and agri-business. As of March 2018, ITC\u2019s gross sales value expanded to Rs 67,081 crore. It posted a net profit of Rs 11,223 crore. ITC will declare its FY19 financial result on Monday.  Prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted: \u201cShri YC Deveshwar made a strong contribution to Indian industry. His efforts helped ITC become a professionally-run Indian company with a global footprint. Saddened by his demise. My thoughts are with his family, friends and the ITC group in this hour of grief.\u201d  ITC was engaged in non-tobacco businesses even before Deveshwar took charge, given the disfavour with which cigarettes are viewed by political establishments, health activists and the general public.  But the strong impetus that this part of the business got under Deveshwar has made ITC synonymous also with luxury hotels, agri-business, paper and paperboards, branded apparel and lifestyle retail, agarbattis, packaged foods, and personal care. It is now a multi-product, hugely diverse conglomerate, and tobacco is just a part of it.  Deveshwar was among the first CEOs to tap India\u2019s vast countryside, by way of his unique e-Choupal concept \u2014 linking directly with farmers via the Internet for procurement of products \u2014 and by entering the FMCG space in rural areas. The going has been tough and the results mixed, although the company takes a long-term view on this.  In fact, dealing with tough situations has been part of Deveshwar\u2019s mental makeup, such as when he took a break from ITC to run Air India in 1991-94 and then on his return to ITC, when he became vice-chairman before taking the top job two years later. These were turbulent times at the company with the largest shareholder, British American Tobacco , at loggerheads with the management led by Deveshwar\u2019s predecessor KL Chugh. The company also had to deal with allegations that it violated the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.  Deveshwar was able to pull around. Having been something of a wunderkind \u2014 he was spotted early by ITC\u2019s legendary chairman AN Haksar and became a board member at 37 \u2014 Deveshwar also gained valuable experience of how the government works during his stint at Air India.  With ailing health and to pass-on the baton to younger executives whom he can groom and mentor to take full charge of a complex multi-faceted organisation, Deveshwar retired from the executive role of CEO at ITC in February 2017 and was appointed by the board as non-executive chairman till 2022. ITC in 2017 appointed Sanjiv Puri at the helm for day-to-day affairs and who continues to be the managing director.  Though Deveshwar shifted to New Delhi for over a year for his treatment, he continued to keep a close watch on ITC and its entire senior management would conduct meetings at Delhi. In fact, the last few board meetings of ITC too were held in Delhi.  In his condolence message, Puri said Deveshwar had passionately championed the cause for sustainable and inclusive growth and the transformative role businesses could play in creating larger societal value.  \"Inspired by a patriotic fervour, manifest in his clarion call of \u2018Lets Put India First\u2019, he led ITC's strategic thrust to create an exemplary Indian enterprise dedicated to serving national priorities,\" said Puri.  Puri said Deveshwar\u2019s leadership transformed ITC into a valuable and admired multi business conglomerate with a robust portfolio of front-ranking businesses in FMCG, hotels, paperboards and paper, packaging and agri-business. \u201cHis Vision to make societal value creation a bedrock of corporate strategy also led ITC to become a global exemplar in sustainability and the only company in the world to be carbon positive, water positive and solid waste positive for over a decade,\" said Puri.  While ITC has retained its lead in the tobacco business accounting for two out of three legal cigarettes sold in the country, the company has a wide spectrum of bestsellers in non-tobacco segments as well. It has created more than 50 popular brands, such as Aashirvaad and Sunfeast to Classmate and Bingo! In FY18, the non-cigarette FMCG business revenue was Rs 11,328 crore, while gross profit of the business was Rs 164 crore.  According to Deveshwar, building successful Indian brands has been ITC\u2019s biggest achievement in an FMCG market that is dominated by multinationals. He has an ambition: to grow ITC\u2019s non-cigarette FMCG business revenue to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030, in the process becoming the largest FMCG firm in the country beating Hindustan Unilever. Puri has time and again said ITC is on the path to achieve Deveshwar\u2019s vision despite of external hiccups like implementation of GST and weak monsoon.  Led by Deveshwar, ITC has received significant global and national recognition for its pioneering work in creating sustainable communities as part of efforts to transform rural India. Some of its achievements have been featured as case studies at Harvard Business School . Harvard had ranked Deveshwar the seventh best-performing CEO in the world in 2012, alongside icons like Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs. In 2011, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan.  Under him, ITC\u2019s focus is on sustainable growth. It has been carbon positive, water positive and solid waste recycling positive for more than a decade years. All its luxury hotels are LEED Platinum certified. Renewable energy constitutes about 48% of ITC\u2019s total energy consumption. It has created 6 million jobs in the country.  Deveshwar has ensured ITC is on a firm footing as a truly global Indian conglomerate with a focus on social development. Such efforts, he believes, will boost the overall economy of the nation. \u201cThe mission to create world-class brands in India must, therefore, assume the fervour of a national movement,\u201d he said some time ago, adding: \u201cSuch world-class Indian brands will help create, capture and retain larger value for the economy.\u201d  Talking to ET, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra paid his tribute to Deveshwar:  \"l will always remember Yogi for two things: first, he was a dragon-slayer; a man who was never afraid of taking on the mightiest of adversaries and the greatest of challenges. Even as he did this, he always had a smile on his face and a good word for all. Second, he began working in what was a multinational from overseas, but by the time he was done, it had been transformed into a true Indian multinational.\"  ITC ex-director Pradeep Dhobale, who retired in 2015 and had worked closely with Deveshwar, recalled his softer side.  \"He was my direct boss for 16 years. Everybody knows him as a visionary, a strategist and a demanding boss. But I have experienced his softer side. In 1999, ITC Bhadrachalam was making losses with not enough money to even pay salaries. While handing over the mantle to me to lead the business, his comment was 'I am giving lives of two thousand families in your hands. Please take care of them',\" Dhobale told ET.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Sanjiv Puri's role after elevation will be to continue YC Deveshwar's legacy</h1>", "description": "ITC Ltd managing director Sanjiv Puri\u2019s responsibility after elevation as the chairman-cum-managing director of the company will be to continue the path set firmly by his illustrious predecessor, YC Deveshwar , who passed away on Saturday.  Puri, 56, becomes the fifth Indian chairman of the cigarette-FMCG-hotel giant, after Ajit Narain Haskar, J N Sapru, K L Chugh and Deveshwar. ITC Ltd board on Monday decided Puri\u2019s appointment also as the chairman with effect from today itself.  In a statement issued by the company, Puri said: \u201cIt is a responsibility that I accept with humility and with a deep resolve to build on the outstanding legacy nurtured over the years, further strengthen and build market leadership across all business segments whilst reinforcing ITC\u2019s commitment to put nation first always. In the journey ahead, I am sure I can count on the support of our shareholders, partners, associates and most of all, the dedicated team ITC to continue our shared aspiration to build an exemplary enterprise of pride to the nation.\u201d  Puri\u2019s appointment as executive chairman and managing director will also not violate SEBI\u2019s directive which says that chairmen of listed companies shall not be executive directors or related to the managing director and necessary changes need to be done by March 31, 2020.  An industry executive said this SEBI directive is not meant for professional-driven company with no clear promoter like ITC. \u201dHence, it is legally not required to split the role of chairman between executive and non-executive. It was split in 2017 so that Deveshwar can step down from day-to-day management and mentor the chosen successors as non-executive chairman,\u201d he said.  Industry executives said since Deveshwar was the non-executive chairman, Puri already was the executive leader and in the thick of action at the conglomerate right from managing day-to-day operations to managing shareholders, government relation and other stakeholders. Puri is also the chairman of ITC\u2019s corporate management committee, the highest executive decision making body in the company, for two years now.  \u201cDeveshwar\u2019s prime responsibility as non-executive chairman was to mentor Puri so he did guide Puri in all big decisions and meetings. In that way, it will be an easy step-in for Puri in the new bigger role,\u201d an executive said.  Puri became ITC CEO in 2017 after Deveshwar stepped down from his executive role and decided to continue as a non-executive chairman. Puri was subsequently re-designated as the managing director last year. Deveshwar had plans to pass-on the chairman post to Puri in 2021-22 when his tenure would end.  An industry executive said two main challenges for Puri will be to insulate the cash spinner cigarette business from recurrent increase in taxation which is shrinking the legal cigarette market in India and to profitably grow the newer FMCG businesses where Deveshwar has already laid down the goal to touch Rs one lakh crore revenue by 2030.  With Puri at the helm, other executive directors in ITC are Nakul Anand (62), who oversees hospitality, travel and tourism and lifestyle retail businesses; B Sumant (55), who looks after cigarettes and FMCG businesses; and Rajiv Tandon (65), the company\u2019s chief financial officer and also in charge of the investment subsidiaries.  There are nine non-executive and independent directors on the board \u2013 one representative each from three large shareholders British American Tobacco, Life Insurance Corp. of India and General Insurers' Association of India; three ex-bureaucrats including two women directors; one retired, senior professional of ITC itself; an ex-banker and LIC\u2019s ex-chairman, who is also ex-administrator of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India.  An alumnus of IIT Kanpur and Wharton School of Business, Puri has been a lifer with ITC much like Deveshwar. He joined the company in 1986 and rose through the ranks like his predecessor.  Between 2001 and 2006, he was MD of Surya Nepal, ITC\u2019s joint venture subsidiary in the neighbouring country. He then led the IT business subsidiary, ITC Infotech India Ltd, as its MD till 2009 when he was appointed the divisional chief executive of the cigarette business with additional responsibility for the entire cigarette and FMCG (fastmoving consumer goods) distribution and the trade marketing vertical.  Puri\u2019s rise has been rapid in the past five years. In 2014, he was made president of the FMCG businesses, a new position that was created to take overall charge of the entire segment comprising cigarettes, packaged food, personal care, education and stationery products, safety matches and agarbattis.  In 2015, Puri became an executive director when he was made overall in charge of FMCG, paperboards, paper and packaging and agri-businesses. In 2016, he was appointed to a new role of chief operating officer. In 2017, Puri was made the CEO, taking independent charge of executive leadership at ITC and was subsequently re-designated as the managing director.

The British cigarettes multinational, which owns 29.58% in ITC, in an email response to ET also said it\u2019s \u201chappy\u201d with its current shareholding. This ends speculations that BAT may want to increase its stake in the Kolkata-based company, especially after it turned down an ITC board proposal to issue stock options to its employees last October.  India, at present, does not allow foreign direct investment in the tobacco sector, but foreign companies can enter into technology collaboration, license trademark and undertake management contracts. The government periodically reviews the FDI norms for the sector.  Puri, who was the managing director at ITC, was named chairman and MD on Monday, following the death of company chairman YC Deveshwar on Saturday. Of the nine non-executive directors on ITC\u2019s board, there is only one representative from BAT: David Robert Simpson. There are four executive directors, including Puri.     Congratulating Puri on his appointment, a BAT spokesperson said: \u201cAs ITC\u2019s largest shareholder, we have always been happy with the performance of the company, and we are confident that this performance will continue under Puri\u2019s leadership. We have been shareholders in ITC since it was incorporated and are happy with our current 29% stake in ITC.\u201d  Life Insurance Corporation of India is the second largest shareholder in ITC with 16.19% holding, followed by Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI\u2019s) with 7.96% stake. ITC has no promoter holding.  BAT has been the only shareholder that often raises some issues with the board. It opposed the ESOP proposal, saying it would dilute its holding.  Around two decades back, BAT wanted to wrest ownership control of ITC which was strongly resisted by the then chairman KL Chugh.  Chugh\u2019s successor Deveshwar had worked hard to ensure that SUUTI\u2019s stake in ITC is not sold to BAT. He believed that BAT was only interested in tobacco and would reverse ITC\u2019s diversification. Around 59% of the net segment revenue of ITC is currently derived from the non-cigarette businesses and is its future bet considering the increasing taxation on cigarettes.

Mondelez, maker of Bournvita, increased its share by 30 bps to 15.2% while the share of Abbott, maker of Pediasure and Ensure, rose 50 bps to 9.2%. \u201cI think the biggest gainer has been Bournvita. Then there are some fringe players,\u201d said Navneet Saluja, managing director, GSK Consumer, at an investors call. \u201cIn volumes share, it\u2019s been really good in the last couple of years, but in value market share, we have been facing headwinds for 8-10 years.\u201d  GSK Consumer\u2019s volume share remained unchanged at 63.9% in FY19. In the first month of the new fiscal, it managed to increase to 65.2%, from 63.8% in April 2018. The company said volume is the \u201cmost critical measure\u201d as it shows the number of consumers using its brands.  India\u2019s health food drinks category is valued at Rs 6,500 crore, growing 12% a year by volumes and 9% by value.  Unilever had bought GSK\u2019s Indian consumer business for $3.8 billion in December last year to cash in on the rising market for health and fitness products. The deal is said to be going through regulatory approval process and expected to be completed by the year-end.  \u201cOur volumes share has gone up on account of the positive impact of GST (since we passed on benefits to consumers) and thematic campaigns such as \u2018exam time\u2019 and \u2018hunger to grow\u2019,\u201d Saluja told ET. \u201cValue share was impacted due to the price reduction post GST rollout.\u201d  Analysts, however, pointed out that rivals Mondelez and Abbott went for sharper price hikes and premium products to boost their value share. \u201cThis was the fourth consecutive quarter of value market share decline for Horlicks; Bournvita has been wresting market share from GSK,\u201d said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president, Edelweiss Securities. \u201cHowever, the pace of decline has slowed and Horlicks continues to be the leader in the health food drinks category.\u201d  GSK Consumer\u2019s management believes its high science portfolio will help it regain market share, Roy said. \u201cWith portfolio eventually being taken over by HUL, we expect distribution synergies-led growth for GSK,\u201d he said.  The contribution of Horlicks\u2019s age group-related brand extensions to the main brand has increased from about 20% in FY11 to 30% in FY19, which has also expanded margins over the years.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">How ITC lit up non-cigarette brands</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: If there\u2019s one company that has created successful brands from scratch after a late start, it\u2019s ITC .  A late entrant in FMCG and packaged foods, ITC challenged domestic and multinational companies alike, following a clear vision of its legendary former chairman Yogi C Deveshwar, to quickly scale the non-cigarette businesses of the company.  How does a company create an impact in a sector dominated by multinational companies? ITC stuck to the classic textbook approach to build the FMCG business, which today boasts of a portfolio of Rs 1,000-crore plus brands, Aashirvaad being the biggest with a turnover of over Rs 4,000 crore.  \u201cITC did in foods, what HUL ( Hindustan Unilever ) did in personal care,\u201d said an FMCG industry expert. Because foods is largely a local subject, ITC managed to create a bigger disruption in foods where consumer trial is high, something that HUL couldn\u2019t do in decades. ITC tapped into those categories where the share of the unorganised market was high, such as atta, where there was a need for consumer branding. \u201cITC mastered this art in foods. In personal care, however, there is less of unorganised play and brand loyalty is a big factor. This has been a challenge for ITC,\u201d said the expert.  Devendra Chawla, another FMCG expert who heads Spencer\u2019s Retail, said: \u201cIt can take years to build a distribution network in towns and villages. It takes time to learn sourcing right in food and not everyone gets consumer insights right. On all these counts, ITC has excelled. It\u2019s this very consumer understanding that has helped ITC grow its food business on local tastes. In foods, a local company has a better understanding of the consumer behaviour. A true farm-to-fork strategy with recent acquisitions has helped ITC grow nascent categories by leveraging on these strengths.\u201d When ITC forayed into foods in 2002 with the launch of the ready-to-eat range \u2018Kitchens of India\u2019, followed by Aashirvaad atta, the industry was bereft of major technological disruptions. ITC put in concerted efforts to build each category it entered while ticking every box in the marketing book.  Marico CEO & MD Saugata Gupta, said: \u201cITC did everything right because they believe in doing everything in the classical copybook way. They invested in backrooms, supply chain and innovation. They managed to create a disruption through quality products created in India, which were then rapidly scaled up.\u201d  Every year was marked by a significant brand/category launch, leading to a non-cigarette FMCG business of Rs 11,000 crore today. The company has set a target to achieve a turnover of Rs 1 lakh crore from non-cigarette FMCG and foods business by 2030. ITC did not shy away from leveraging capabilities from its existing businesses. It used its hotels network, and based on insights from chefs, arrived at the right flavours to woo consumers. Its agri sourcing network and e-choupal helped build an end-to-end network. It also outspent other FMCG companies when it came to advertising, according to Abneesh Roy, senior VP, Edelweiss Financial Services. \u201cITC had the ability to plough profits it earned from other businesses like cigarettes into growing the FMCG/foods portfolios. While earlier they focused on the mass segments, in the last 5-6 years there was a clear departure from this strategy to focus on mid-to-premium end of the market to earn higher gross margins. For about 5-6 years they did not make a profit in FMCG. Now they make decent margins. This strategy was important to take on players that were already well entrenched in the market.\u201d  Whether it is Dark Fantasy Choco Fills cookies or innovations like a pocket deo in Engage, investing in product innovation has helped ITC garner significant share of certain categories. ITC is a market leader in atta, stationary, cream biscuits, bridges segment and it\u2019s the second leading player in deodorants, shower gels, noodles and agarbatti.  In different categories, ITC competes with PepsiCo , Nestle , HUL, Britannia and Parle, among others.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Ousted by lenders, Naresh Goyal tries to re-enter Jet Airways' cockpit</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal filed an expression of interest (EoI) for a stake in the ailing carrier just as the deadline for submissions was coming to an end on Friday, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The move is said to have flummoxed lenders , who have put the equity on sale as part of a rescue plan for the airline. They have asked for legal advice on how to respond to the move by Goyal, who recently quit as chairman and director and had previously said he was ready to sacrifice control of the carrier to ensure its survival.  Until this late development, Goyal\u2019s departure had been seen as a key element of any revival strategy, having been unable to prevent the airline\u2019s slide.  Goyal and Jet officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Details of Goyal\u2019s EoI weren\u2019t available.     A senior executive of State Bank of India said all EoIs are being examined by the legal department for their authenticity and that this is part of the normal procedure. He didn\u2019t elaborate.  Meanwhile, Etihad has specified to Jet\u2019s lenders in its EoI that it wants to keep its shareholding below 25% and doesn\u2019t want to be the sole or majority shareholder in the distressed carrier. It currently owns 24% of Jet. Etihad and the airline\u2019s top lender SBI didn\u2019t respond to queries.  Two people in the know said Goyal is being treated as an \u201cerrant promoter\u201d. According to the rules, such a promoter can\u2019t participate in debt resolution once a company has entered the bankruptcy process, but Jet hasn\u2019t got to that stage yet, bankers said.   Staff Surround Jet Office  Goyal has pledged a little over 31% of the company\u2019s shares and has agreed to pledge more, totalling 41.1% of the company, people in the know have said. His current total shareholding is 51%. The public owns 25% of Jet.  The deadline for the submission of EoIs was 6 pm Friday. The EoIs are non-binding.  Etihad submitted its EoI on Thursday night, joining a host of private equity firms including TPG Capital and Indigo Partners. Spokespersons at both firms declined to comment. The government-anchored National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) will bid too, people in the know had said. Being a state-run entity, it doesn\u2019t have to submit EoIs. A senior executive at NIIF said he wouldn\u2019t be able to comment.  That Etihad\u2019s shareholding remains below 25% \u201cis imperative so that the equity infusion is immediate and the funds actually go to the running of the business; instead of an open offer being triggered which may be used as an exit strategy by minority investors\u201d, said a person with knowledge of the EoI.  \u201cThere is a requirement for additional, yet to be identified, eligible investors to meet the entire equity requirements of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt (Etihad) will make the decision to place a bid for a stake in Jet Airways based on these and other key conditions being met.\u201d  The next stage is the qualification of bids. Qualified entities must send in binding bids by April 30.  Meanwhile, lenders to Jet have told its management to give a fresh loan proposal and will discuss any emergency funding on Monday, the aviation secretary said on Friday.  Jet has suspended international flights until Monday, shrunk its operating fleet to 11planes and will further shrink it to six-seven planes during the weekend, said Pradeep Singh Kharola, the aviation secretary. Jet is India\u2019s oldest surviving private airline and was till January it\u2019s secondbiggest with a fleet of 124 planes.  Jet\u2019s lenders have internally decided they won\u2019t release loans until there is some clarity on a new investor, said two people aware of the matter. The decision was made in a lenders\u2019 meet on Thursday night.  Jet had been assured loans of Rs 1,500 crore \u2014 Rs 400 crore in the first tranche and Rs 1,100 crore in the second. Of that, only about Rs 200 crore has been released and has been used up in payments to fuel companies, other vendors besides salaries for December. Lessors have not been paid.  Jet\u2019s ground staff surrounded the airline\u2019s corporate office in suburban Mumbai and asked the management for updates on their salary dues, a pilots\u2019 grouping said in an internal communication. The airline\u2019s chief people officer Rahul Taneja could be seen pacifying employees who haven\u2019t been paid for months.  Some of them complained about being manhandled by angry passengers following flight cancellations and said the management should be present to tackle the situation. Taneja said he would go to the airport on Friday evening to do so.

Top mutual funds including Aditya Birla , HDFC, Reliance, ICICI Prudential , and Kotak Mahindra have invested in those triple-A rated debt papers, known as Pass-Through Certificates (PTCs), yielding 9.7%.  Reliance Industries, of which Reliance Retail is a part, didn\u2019t answer ET\u2019s mailed queries on the subject until the publication of this report.  OPC Asset Solutions, a leasing company, has securitised the lease rentals due from the country\u2019s largest retailer Reliance Retail.  Structured financing, a special form of debt funding, is evolving fast. Companies usually raise money by securitising a pool of loan receivables. This is, perhaps, for the first time that the securitisation route has been used for enabling a large-scale lease rental transaction.  Lease rentals save capital expenditure and overhead costs.  \u201cThis is the first time that a company raised money through securitisation of lease rentals,\u201d said Vibhor Mittal, head \u2013 structured finance, ICRA, which rated these securities at AAA (SO). \u201cSuch an investment has low credit risk due to assured rentals coming from top-rated companies.\"  As part of the deal, OPC Asset Solutions, the lessor, could buy the equipment to lease them to Reliance Retail for three years. OPC uses money raised through the PTCs. There is a separate securitisation trust, which will issue PTCs that are backed by lease rentals coming from Reliance Retail. Domestic asset management companies would invest in those PTCs, which are also tradable in the secondary market.  OPC Asset offers asset renting solutions for various movable assets, such as furniture, computers, servers, ATMs, point of sale terminals, and construction equipment.  Three sets of PTCs offered interest rates in the range of 8.25%, 9.25% and 9.7% between May and December last year, market sources said.  Reliance Retail obtained this innovative route to raise the whole sum in three tranches - Rs 1,500 crore, Rs 5,500 crore and Rs 5,000 crore.

According to industry estimates, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles dropped more than 20% last month, the sharpest decline since May 2017, when volumes fell by 33% to 16,716 units vehicles. Share prices of many commercial vehicle makers are now close to their 52 week lows.  \u201cThere is a lot of control over banks and mutual funds lending to NBFCs after the IL&FS crisis. This has reduced loan availability to truck operators, limiting their ability to purchase vehicles,\u201d said Vinod Aggarwal, managing director, VE Commercial Vehicles, a venture between Volvo and Eicher Motors .  VE Commercial sold 3,935 units last month, a 7% decline from a year earlier. Sales at market leader Tata Motors dropped 24% to 9,793 units last month, while Ashok Leyland\u2019s sales dipped 18% to 8,718.     \u201cNovember was challenging due to low consumer sentiments as a result of liquidity tightening in the market, higher interest rates and rising fuel costs,\u201d said Girish Wagh, president (commercial vehicle business) at Tata Motors.  Additionally, a change in norms that allows commercial vehicles to carry more has affected sales.  \u201cSale of 100 trucks adds as much carrying capacity as earlier sale of 115-120 trucks. However, increase in freight demand is dependent on GDP growth, which has largely remained unchanged,\u201d said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive), Mahindra & Mahindra. \u201cWith freight capacity increasing at a faster pace than freight demand, there is downward pressure on freight rates and slowdown in truck sales.\u201d  Mahindra\u2019s medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales slid 20% to 637 units in November.  Industry executives said they expect demand to remain weak in the near term and improve somewhat in the last quarter. \u201cWe expect to see a rebound in the coming months as liquidity has started to ease and fuel prices have moderated due to reduction in global crude prices,\u201d said Wagh.  \u201cA lot of investments are being made in infrastructure projects, expected to fuel demand for construction trucks,\u201d said Aggarwal.  \u201cQ4 F19 may witness some revival due to the usual year-end increase in buying and thrust to government-led infrastructure projects and other spending,\u201d concurred Wadhera.

A meeting of Committee of Creditors (CoC) was held on Friday to consider the revised offers of both NBCC Ltd and Suraksha group to acquire Jaypee Infratech and complete over 20,000 housing units in various projects in Noida.  According to a source, the CoC decided not to consider the NBCC's bid as it found the offer to be conditional and subject to approvals from various government departments.  The offer of NBCC, a public sector unit under the aegis of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, put some other conditions as well.  In the meeting, NBCC representatives sought some time to take approvals from different government departments, sources added.  Under the insolvency law, conditional bids are not allowed.  NBCC had submitted its revised bid on April 24 and offered to give lenders Rs 5,000 crore worth land parcels as against the earlier offer of land worth Rs 3,000 crore. But it was offering only 950 acres of land as against 1,450 acres earlier.  Suraksha group has also made an offer of land worth Rs 5,000 crore.  NBCC offered lenders the Yamuna Expressway that connects Noida to Agra in Uttar Pradesh in both earlier and revised bids.  Meanwhile, business conglomerate Adani Group had also expressed interest to bid for Jaypee Infratech. However, lenders are unlikely to seek Adani's offer until this round of insolvency proceedings gets completed.  Last week, crisis-hit Jaypee Group 's promoters made a fresh attempt to retain control over its arm Jaypee Infratech by seeking the support of homebuyers for its debt resolution plan under the IBC.  Jaypee Group Chairman Manoj Gaur had apologised to thousands of distressed homebuyers and promised to infuse Rs 2,000 crore to complete apartments over the next four years. The group had submitted a Rs 10,000-crore plan before lenders in April 2018 as well, but the same was not accepted.  In 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of Jaypee Infratech.  Anuj Jain was appointed the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) to oversee the company's operations and undertake insolvency proceedings.  In the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha group, was rejected by lenders as it was found to be substantially lower than the company's net worth and assets.  In October 2018, the IRP started a fresh initiative to revive Jaypee Infratech on the NCLT's direction. The realty firm has an outstanding debt of nearly Rs 9,800 crore.  Jaypee Group's flagship firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) had submitted Rs 750 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court for the refund to buyers and the amount is lying with the NCLT.

The premium truck brand, owned by the Volkswagen Group, recently appointment Novotny as MD, quashing speculation that the company would follow MAN Trucks, another division of Volkswagen, in exiting India. MAN stopped operations last year.  \u201cAs we begin our new journey, our focus is on a sustainable profitable growth, and that means we will not run after market share gain,\u201d Novotny said. \u201cOur focus will be on value selling to create a long-term partnership with our customers.\u201d  Scania, which entered India with a local manufacturing base in 2013, suffered a setback in the country as its investments in the bus business failed to take off. Last year, it wound up its bus bodybuilding plant due to poor demand for its premium buses. Novotny ascribed it to miscalculation of demand, but said the company\u2019s commitment to the mining truck segment remains very strong.  The company, however, sees high-end off-road mining and on-road trucks to be its mainstay in the years to come. People in the know said Scania\u2019s has chalked out a five-year plan which focuses on utilising its capacity (1,200 units in one shift/2,400 in two shifts) and achieving breakeven for its investment in India.  Novtony did not give any numbers or time frame but said his aim would be utilise capacity at the earliest and look at building a sustainable business operation.

Scania sold about 300 trucks priced over Rs 2 crore in the Indian high-end commercial vehicles segment, which sees sales of 1,200-1,500 units every year. Scania does not share its sales figures with industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).  Apart from revamping its mining truck segment with new products, Novotny said a range of on-road truck applications are being studied to participate in the India infrastructure growth story.  Novotny, who has spent significant time in Africa, said that by getting the fundamentals in place, the company\u2019s operations in the region had grown many folds in terms of volume and profit. In India, the company may follow a similar path, hence it is reigniting its India strategy.  Before joining Scania, Novotny had worked brands like Philip Morris International, Coca-Cola and Deloitte in various leadership capacities.  Being a fringe player, Scania is promising an assured buyback to its potential customers to build confidence in them. Novotny said the company\u2019s job just doesn\u2019t end with selling a truck, Scania\u2019s executives will work very closely with their clients to deliver an optimum driving cycle for its buyers.

In a letter to IRP Anuj Jain, NBCC said it would soon get the approvals of various government departments on its revised offer submitted on April 24. The public sector unit emphasised that its resolution plan to revive Jaypee Infratech safeguards the interests of bankers as well as home-buyers.  A committee of creditors (CoC), in its meeting on April 26, decided not to consider NBCC's bid as it was subject to the approval of various government departments.  NBCC, had during the lenders meet, sought some time to take all the necessary approvals. But, the lenders decided to put on vote on April 30, the offer of Suraksha Realty-led consortium and not that of NBCC.  According to sources, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has also approached the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management and the Department of Expenditure for seeking approval on revised bid.  In a letter to the IRP, NBCC said it is very much interested in acquiring bankruptcy-bound Jaypee Infratech.  NBCC had informed to the lenders panel that the company was in process of seeking government approvals and it should be given some time before the voting could be carried out on its plan, the letter said.  \"NBCC continues to be very interested in the resolution process and accord the interest of the home-buyers, utmost priority,\" the letter said adding that the company entered into insolvency proceedings of Jaypee Infratech to provide relief to over 20,000 home-buyers.  To protect financial creditors that has an exposure of nearly Rs 9,800 crore in the Jaypee Infratech, NBCC said it has offered Rs 5,000 crore worth of land as well as 100 per cent equity in Yamuna Expressway .  The Expressway, which connects Noida to Agra in Uttar Pradesh, is the only cash generating asset (Rs 350 crore annually as toll income) lying with the Jaypee Infratech.  \"We are confident that our proposal will safeguard the interest of the home-buyers and the lenders. Therefore, we request the CoC to consider our proposal on merit,\" NBCC concluded in the letter.  Meanwhile, business conglomerate Adani Group had also recently expressed interest to bid for Jaypee Infratech. However, lenders are unlikely to seek Adani's offer until this round of insolvency proceedings gets completed.  Crisis-hit Jaypee Group's promoters too have made a fresh attempt to retain control over its realty arm Jaypee Infratech by seeking the support of home-buyers for its debt resolution plan submitted under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).  Jaypee Group Chairman Manoj Gaur has promised to infuse Rs 2,000 crore to complete apartments over the next four years. The group had submitted a Rs 10,000-crore plan before lenders in April 2018, as well, but the same was not accepted by the lenders.  In 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of Jaypee Infratech. In the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha group, was rejected by lenders as it was found to be substantially lower than the company's net worth and assets.  In October 2018, the IRP started a fresh initiative to revive Jaypee Infratech on the NCLT's direction.  Jaypee Group's flagship firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) had submitted Rs 750 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court for the refund to buyers and the amount is lying with the NCLT.

To begin with, the NHAI is likely to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the 1,320-km Delhi-Mumbai expressway and seek equity participation, a government official aware of the matter told ET.  \u201cWe are exploring a possibility of forming an SPV for the (Delhi-Mumbai) project. The land acquisition costs will be borne by NHAI,\" the official said.  \u201cFor funding of construction posts, the SPV will offer equity and debt to investors in packets of certain amounts.\u201d  This mechanism will need a cabinet approval and that will happen once the new government is formed. The contours of the new model will be ready in the next three months, the official said.  NHAI has held preliminary discussions with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). \"We are getting good feelers from financial investors, pension funds on this,\" the official said. The government had introduced the Tolloperate-transfer (TOT) model in 2016 for monetisation of publicly-funded highways . Under the model, investors make a one-time lump sum payment in return for long-term toll collection rights backed by a sound tolling system. The first round of TOT auctions exceeded government\u2019s expectations to fetch over Rs 9,000 crore. However, the second round of auctions expected to garner Rs 5,362 crore, was cancelled earlier this year as the bids received were far below the government's expectations.     While NHAI is working on re-bundling the second round of TOT auction, the new funding model seeks to garner interest from Indian investors and foreign institutional investors for greenfield projects.  \u201cWe\u2019ll have to gauge the response of longterm investors because it is obviously a very large project, the cost of which will upwards of Rs 20,000 crore. So the first point is no one will purchase the SPV because it is very expensive, like TOT,\u201d said Vinayak Chatterjee, Chairman, Feedback Infra, explaining the rationale for the move.  \u201cSo they want to give chunks of equity to long-term investors so that it is almost like a consortium funding,\u201d he added. It would be interesting for NHAI to test out the structure with investor meetings in India and abroad and test the appetite and tweak it in a manner that will make it more acceptable to investors, he added. \u201cIt's an idea worth pursuing,\u201d Chatterjee said.

While IDBI Bank is not averse to the idea, some of the other lenders are not in favour of the plan, although a final call is yet to be taken, bankers told TOI. They are worried over the recent trend to hand over ailing companies \u2014 ranging from Jet Airways to Jaypee Infratech .  While a rescue is tough in many cases, the banks do not have the wherewithal to run the operations. \u201cAnd, when the regime changes, the government of the day will blame us for making a mess of things and creating non-performing assets (NPAs),\u201d said a high-ranking executive with a state-run bank.  While Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) did not respond to a questionnaire, an Essel Infratech spokesperson said, \u201cWe are not aware about any such development from HSIIDC or any other third party. However, we would prefer continuing to own the project till the end of the contracted concession tenure.\u201d     In a proposal submitted to an arbitration panel last week, HSIIDC has given two options. The first one is for the lenders to take over all claims, liabilities and dues of the current concessionaire Essel Infraprojects, and their bankers. HSIIDC can pay the halfyearly annuity amount of Rs 157.5 crore each to the lenders for 14 and a half years. In this case, the state government entity will have the right to collect toll to offset the costs.  The other option is for IDBI Bank and other lenders to take over the project and tolling, all claims, liabilities and dues of Rs 1,700 crore of Essel Infraprojects and its lenders. In this case, HSIIDC won\u2019t pay the annuity amount as the lenders would recover the entire amount from tolling. Moreover, as part of this package, the lenders would pay HSIIDC Rs 500 crore and get the right to collect toll. The daily toll collection on the entire expressway is estimated at around Rs 52 lakh.  If the proposal is accepted, it will come as a relief for Essel Infratech as it would get back its investment upfront instead of waiting for 14 more years to recover the amount. But for the lenders, the negotiation would mean putting almost Rs 4,000 crore, including the amount it had lent for the project, to its original concessionaire DSC.  IDBI Bank will be allowed to continue its recoveries against the KMP Expressway in the Debt Recovery Tribunal.

In the past few months, construction equipment makers have cut production while awarding of new road contracts has stalled as the government curbed capital expenditure to meet the FY19 deficit target.  The central government has spent only Rs 2.73 lakh crore out of the estimated Rs 3.15 lakh crore capital expenditure target for the year ended March, data for the first 11 months of the year show. According to the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), the government\u2019s capital expenditure in the first 11 months of the previous fiscal year dropped 8%, affecting to some extent the potential production or order book of key companies across sectors.  One of the key sectors to feel the impact of government\u2019s falling capital expenditure is roads infrastructure . The awarding activity of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has slowed down. Against a target to award 7,500 km in FY19, NHAI has awarded only 2,222 km.  It is estimated that execution of road projects is likely to miss the target by 35%. Not surprisingly, the reduced flow of money has impacted construction equipment companies. These companies estimate production cuts of 15-60%.  Leading construction equipment companies such as JCB and Tata Hitachi \u2014 that are primarily into manufacturing of backhoe loaders, excavators, crane and forklifts \u2014 have cut production by 15-60% for the next few months, vendors told ET.  JCB, the largest construction equipment company with more than 50% market share, has cut production to 1950 vehicles (mainly backhoe loaders and excavators) per month in May from a monthly run-rate of more than 3,000 vehicles per day in the previous fiscal year. The total volume of construction equipment in India stood at 100,000-110,000 in 2018 and grew at 25-30% in the same period.  A vendor for a construction equipment company said these companies had cut production on uncertainty regarding demand due to impending general elections and hazy demand outlook.  Sandeep Singh, MD at Tata Hitachi, said the company had undertaken a 5% correction in January-March and will correct its schedule by 10-15% for the April-June quarter. Singh says the NBFC crisis had impacted business in the first quarter of 2019 and some slowdown in construction equipment is usually seen ahead of elections. This time, he says, the slowdown appears more pronounced.  \u201cIn January-April, the market is already down by about 10%. The offtake is expected to remain weak in the coming few months before the new government takes charge. Traditionally, July and August are slower months due to monsoon. We expect the real offtake post September. It is not that the orders are not there, there is a lot of work, it is the availability of funds that is slowing down projects,\u201d he added.  According to market leader JCB, payments to contractors are being held up and that is affecting demand. JCB says business was flat so far with a downward bias and it is calibrating its schedule based on demand outlook.

The slowdown in government investment is also reflected in key high-frequency indicators. The sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) fell in five out of past six months. MHCV volume growth in the second half of FY19 fell 4.45% compared with 61.99% growth in the first half.  It must be noted that the tipper segment, which is used mainly in construction activity, has been driving growth for the MHCV segment in the previous fiscal. Similarly, the volume of lubes and grease, mainly used in industrial activity, fell 15% between the January and March period of FY19 compared with a growth of 16.4% in the first nine months of FY19.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Jaypee Infra insolvency: Over 23,000 homebuyers, 13 banks start voting on NBCC's bid</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: Homebuyers and lenders of debt-laden Jaypee Infratech Thursday started voting on state-owned NBCC's bid to acquire Jaypee group 's realty firm and complete the construction of over 20,000 flats.  The voting process will end on Sunday and the outcome would be declared on May 20.  The financial creditors would vote for the second time on the resolution plan for Jaypee Infratech, a subsidiary of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL). On May 3, the financial creditors rejected Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty's bid through voting process.  As many as 13 banks represent 40.71 per cent voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) while over 23,000 homebuyers have around 59 per cent vote.  Majority of homebuyers are likely to vote in favour of the NBCC's bid but many also fear that lenders may reject it as they do not want to take up to 60 per cent hair-cut against their claim of Rs 9,782 crore, sources had said.  Earlier this week, the CoC decided to put on vote the revised offer of NBCC, with homebuyers favouring the voting process while bankers dissenting.  Bankers had opposed putting the NBCC's bid to vote and pitched for further negotiations. Banks even made a plea before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) for a stay on the voting process, but did not get relief.  In its revised offer, NBCC has proposed infusion of Rs 200 crore equity capital, transfer of 950 acres of land worth Rs 5,000 crore as well as Yamuna Expressway to banks and completion of flats construction by July 2023 in order to settle an outstanding claim of Rs 23,723 crore of financial creditors.  The bankers' opposition came against the backdrop of NBCC Monday ruling out dilution of certain conditions, including exemption from tax liability, in its revised offer.  Bankers even proposed taking control of Jaypee Infratech and roping in NBCC as Project Management Consultant (PMC) to complete delayed flats, sources had said.  However, Kuldeep Verma, who represents homebuyers in the CoC, wanted NBCC's offer to be put to vote without any delay.  Verma's views prevailed as homebuyers have nearly 60 per cent voting rights in the CoC, sources had said.  A minimum 66 per cent vote of financial creditors (bankers and homebuyers) is required for the approval of any resolution plan.  Last week, lenders had written to NBCC seeking clarifications on certain relief and concessions put forward by the public sector firm in its resolution plan.  However, NBCC decided not to dilute the conditions of exemption from income tax liability as well as from taking consent of development authorities for transfer of businesses.  Clarifications from the NBCC were sought in the wake of the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) flagging to the lenders that NBCC's bid was conditional and non-binding.  Jaypee Infratech's IRP Anuj Jain had written to the CoC that NBCC's revised bid was conditional as the plan would not be binding unless key relief measures such as extinguishing of income tax liability and exemption from seeking consent of YEIDA (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) for any business transfer.  The court-mandated deadline for completing the resolution plan for Japyee Infratech ended on May 6, and the CoC has sought an extension of the deadline. The matter is listed on May 21, with the Allahabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  Meanwhile, Adani Group has shown interest to bid for Jaypee Infratech but creditors have not sought resolution plan from Adani so far. Jaypee Group's promoters too have put in a bid, under Section 12A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, to retain control of the company.  Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency in 2017 after the NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of the firm.

In recent months, the country's financial system has been grappling with multiple woes in the wake of the turmoil at diversified IL&FS group as well as debt defaults by some other large entities.  In an interview to PTI, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas said the NBFC sector is facing issues of credit squeeze, over-leveraging and misadventures by some large entities.  \"There is an imminent crisis in the NBFC sector. There is a credit squeeze, over-leveraging, excessive concentration, massive mismatch between assets and liabilities, coupled with some misadventures by some very large entities, which is a perfect recipe for disaster,\" Srinivas said.  However, he added that \"responsible\" companies are managing the risk well and are not facing such a dire situation.  Srinivas also said corporate governance in India is being put to test.  \"It is a defining moment. The way things are moving, in the medium to long term it will be for the good. In the short term, there can be turbulence,\" he said.  \"If you are responsible, you manage the risks. There are many companies in the country that have strong corporate governance. They take risks but manage them as well. So, they don't face such dire situation that some others are facing today,\" Srinivas said.  Amid instances of the situation of non-performing assets (NPAs) being linked to external factors, Srinivas noted that it would not be a convincing explanation.  \"To say that the situation (NPA) can be attributed entirely to external factors and business risks is not a convincing answer because there is something known as responsible behaviour,\" he emphasised.  Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the banking sector is \"under severe stress\" and the way out of \"this mess\" is to reverse some \"gross distortions\", work closely with the RBI, re-start the process of credit delivery and ensure sufficient liquidity and cash in circulation.  The NPA \"scare\" has brought lending to a virtual halt, the former prime minister had said, adding that a \"one-size-fits-all approach\" drove companies into insolvency while demonetisation shut out all sources of informal credit.  However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had dismissed the concerns, saying, \"When an economist turns into a politician, he loses sense of both economy and politics\".  \"Dr Manmohan Singh left behind in 2014 an economic slowdown, policy paralysis and corruption. He brought down his party to lowest ever strength in Parliament. India was a part of the fragile five. Today he regards the world's the fastest growing major economy as disastrous,\" Jaitley had said.

Manish Vyas, President of Communications Business and Chief Executive Officer of Network Services, Tech Mahindra said 4G is yet to touch all parts of the country, and while that happens on a massive scale, there are some \"definite green-shoots\" of 5G trials.  More than technology however, the bigger impediment could be the regulatory body's policy on 5G spectrum.  The experimental license by DoT will need modifications, and till that happens, the sector is in for a \"waiting game,\" he said.  \"US, Australia, Italy, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and more (have started 5G spectrum auctions). Spectrum is the life blood of any wireless network. For 5G, globally regulators have been licensing mid-band (3.5GHz) and in some countries mmWave (millimeter Wave) spectrum bands as well.  For 5G to be rolled out in India, the first necessary step is for the regulator to auction the 5G spectrum. Everything else will be gated on spectrum,\" he told in an email.  India's largest telecom operator Vodafone Idea recently said the auction of 5G spectrum should not be held before 2020 as the industry needs time to develop India-specific use cases for the next-generation technology.  A DoT official in December last year said the government expects to complete processes for 5G spectrum auction by August, 2019.

Two people familiar with the development said that the NCLT\u2019s bench heard IDBI\u2019s plea today but scheduled a hearing on May 6 which also happens to be the deadline to complete the insolvency process for debt-hit realtor.  \u201cHome buyers and lenders\u2019 e-voting is expected to continue for 3 days starting Tuesday and the outcome will be known by Friday,\u201d said one of the persons mentioned above.  The Sudhir Valia promoted Suraksha Realty-led consortium is the only bidder left in the fray after bankers rejected the bid of state-owned NBCC for lack of approvals from government authorities. However, a meeting of Committee of Creditors (COC) earlier scheduled to take place on Tuesday has now been cancelled.  An IDBI Bank spokesperson declined to comment for the story.  The NCLT had granted extension to the lenders and Interim Resolution Professional Anuj Jain to complete the CIRP by 90 days as 180 days mandated under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was coming to an end on February 5, 2019.  Under the IBC, a resolution process has to be completed within 180 days with a further extension of 90 days to 270 days. As per the rules, if the company fails to complete the CIRP within the mandated 270 days, then the company goes for liquidation.  IDBI is believed to have requested the tribunal to factor the litigation period at several judicial forums, which includes the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Supreme Court.  IDBI's plea was supported by the representative of the home buyers, who have also got the status of financial creditors after amendments in the IBC.  The promoters of Jaypee Infratech , however, have opposed any move to extend the resolution period.  Meanwhile, NBCC is making efforts to get approvals for its submitted revised bid from relevant authorities.  Jaypee Infratech has an outstanding debt of about Rs 9,800 crore. Its lenders include IDBI, IIFCL, Axis Bank, Bank Of Maharashtra, Corporation Bank, ICICI Bank, IFCI, J&K Bank, LIC, SBI, Syndicate Bank, Srei Equipment Finance, and Union Bank.

Early this week, a group headed by IIT Kanpur Director professor Abhay Karandikar submitted its views on kickstarting the 5G-based field trials in India.  The source privy to the matter, however, said that the panel's suggestions are bit complex in nature, and added that it has recommended one year as an initial trial duration that requires a nod every three months, and that can be further extended to a year more with nominal charges or Rs 5,000 per trial.  In addition, the panel has also sought 100Mhz of spectrum in the 3300-3600Mhz range as well as 400Mhz in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band.  The official also added that the department has \"more or less\" finalised the steps for next airwaves sales which would be placed before the DCC, the highest decision-making body of the telecom sector.  On asking about worldwide concerns including the US blacklisting Chinese gear maker Huawei , the official acknowledged that the department has received a letter from the telco group, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), and added that a policy decision would be taken on the contentious issue soon.  The incumbent telcos particularly Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel demanded clarity from the government on using equipment from Huawei for the 5G rollout.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">India's apparel exports estimated to de-grow by 4-5% in FY2019</h1>", "description": "India\u2019s apparel exports are estimated to de-grow by 4-5% in FY2019, following a similar de-growth of 4% in FY 2018 and modest growth rates of 1% and 3% in FY2016 and FY2017 respectively, says an ICRA report.  While a reversal in trend has been witnessed in the recent months with a 14% Y-o-Y growth in India\u2019s apparel exports in Q3 FY2019, the growth is overstated considering a sharp decline reported during Q3 FY2018, amid downward revision in export incentives under the GST regime. As a result, India\u2019s apparel exports in Q3 FY2019 remained lower than the average quarterly exports during the past five years. Having said that, ICRA expects the trend to have bottomed out and recovery to set in with internal challenges and abrupt pressures subsiding, though the pace of recovery is likely to remain muted considering the challenging environment.  Commenting on the subdued industry trend, Mr. Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, ICRA, says, \u201cThe decline in India\u2019s apparel exports in FY2019 so far has been primarily driven by a sharp inexplicable decline witnessed in shipments to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from July 2017 onwards. Yet, the trend otherwise also has not been encouraging. If the trade with UAE is excluded, India\u2019s apparel exports stood flat (vis-\u00e0-vis a 7% decline in India\u2019s overall apparel exports) in 10M FY2019. As this weakness coincides with a time when the global apparel trade has shown signs of positive momentum, it remains a cause of concern.\u201d  As for the global apparel trade, the same expanded for the second consecutive year in CY2018 (refers to Calendar Year) with a Y-o-Y growth of ~3%, following a 2% growth in CY2017 in US$ terms and contractions reported earlier in CY2015 and CY2016. The positive trend during the last two years has been led by the strong recovery in apparel imports by the European Union (EU), which accounts for almost two-fifth of the global apparel trade (including the trade within EU) and reported a growth of 5.8% in CY2018. Unlike the EU, apparel imports by the United States of America (US) remain muted with a 2% growth in CY2018, though the trend has improved during the past two years.  As per ICRA note, India continues to experience headwinds in the form of intense competitive pressures from nations having a cost advantage over India, which seem to be constraining the overall momentum of the apparel export sector of India.  \u201cWhile China \u2013 the world\u2019s largest apparel manufacturer and exporter, continues to shed market share in the global trade, India has not been able to capitalise on the opportunity. Instead, a large chunk has been garnered by Bangladesh and Vietnam, the second and the third largest apparel exporting nations globally. While Bangladesh has been the key beneficiary in the EU, Vietnam has maintained growth in its stronghold market of the US.\u201d, adds Roy.  The concerns are heightened by the developments in the international trade including allegations of the US against certain export subsidy schemes in India as well as progress on certain large free trade agreements (FTA) which can materially alter the global trade dynamics. The most prominent amongst these is the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership (CP TPP), which is the third largest free trade area in the world by GDP. By mid-January 2019, the agreement had entered into force between seven of the eleven nations. Even though there is some respite for India considering that the leading apparel importing regions are not yet a part of the CP TPP, any incremental developments on this front could prove to be a potential threat as it could considerably strengthen Vietnam\u2019s competitiveness. Another FTA being closely watched is the EU-Vietnam FTA. Conclusion of the FTA can weaken India\u2019s competitive positioning in one of the key apparel markets, accounting for ~37% of India\u2019s apparel exports in CY2018. This can be corroborated from the fact that Bangladesh, which enjoys a duty-free access to the EU market since 2001 under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, has been able to expand its market share in EU from less than 7% in 2001 to ~20% at present, while India has been able to barely maintain its share at ~6-7%.  ICRA research also notes that a sample of large, listed, domestic as well as export-focused garment-manufacturing companies has continued to perform well, reporting a 13% (YoY) growth in Q3 FY2019, following the similar average growth rate during the previous four quarters. ICRA believes that presence in the niche and value-added product segments, together with access to an established client base has helped export-based companies to maintain revenue growth, in contrast to the broad industry trend. This, together with a revival in domestic demand, particularly in metros and tier-I markets where the larger listed players are predominantly present, translated into a healthy growth for ICRA\u2019s sample during the current financial year. Besides, favourable currency movement and healthy growth in revenues facilitated an improvement in margins in the recent quarters, given the operating leverage inherent in the operations. Supported by better margins, the aggregate interest cover for ICRA\u2019s sample also improved, averaging ~5.7 times in 9M FY2019 vis-a-vis ~5.0 times in 9M FY2018.  Going forward, steps taken by the Government of India to address the challenges, will remain crucial for a broad-based recovery across the sector. This also remains critical for the domestic apparel exporters to capitalise on the revived global apparel trade as well as the continuing loss of market share by China, which opens up a lucrative opportunity for key players such as India, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">A ready reckoner on pre-approved home loans</h1>", "description": "Have you ever received a call or an sms from a bank or a financial institution stating that you are eligible for an instant home loan? If so, then you belong to the privileged few who have been selected for a pre-approved loan even before you have finalised a property. In this article, PNB Housing explains the merits of pre-approved home loans.  A pre-approved home loan is an in-principle offer from a lender granting you a loan of a specific amount and may be at a special interest rate. It gives you a head start over those who have to first scout for a property and then approach a financial institution for home loan. It is, however, important to remember that the offer is usually valid for a certain period. At PNB Housing, this term usually varies from three to six months. Terms and conditions such as EMI, tenure and interest rates are subject to change during this period.  You can also apply for a quick approval on your home loan through PNB Housing\u2019s Instant Loan facility by clicking here .  Unlike a home loan that you apply for after choosing a suitable property, a pre-approved loan is offered to you basis your income, financial position, and credit history or creditworthiness.  A pre-approved home loan helps you decide the right price-range for the property you plan to buy. The loan is disbursed after you have identified the property, and fulfilled the financial institution\u2019s legal and technical requirements. For example, if there is a dispute over the property title, the lender may not disburse the loan until the issue is resolved.  A pre-approved home loan has many benefits. Some of these include:   Planned budget: With a pre-approved home loan, you will know exactly how much funds you have and how much more you need to arrange or borrow. It also helps you to decide on the extent of down payment against the property and the EMI tenure.   Focused search: Once you know that you are eligible for loan for a specified amount, you will have more time to look for a property that fits your budget and in a location of your choice. This saves both time and effort.   Faster disbursal: Since the bank or the financial institution has offered you the home loan, it will speed up the verification process and ensure quick disbursal of the loan. This is particularly helpful if the property transaction has to be carried out within a specific time.  Before you opt for a pre-approved loan, you need to keep two important factors in mind\u2014 read all the terms and conditions mentioned in the sanction letter carefully before taking any disbursal to ensure that you can meet them without any hassle; and take note of the rate of interest offered as it is usually floating is nature, hence can change by the time the disbursement takes place. Do check the final interest rate being offered once you finalise the property.  As mentioned earlier, a pre-approved home loan is only an in-principle offer and does not guarantee automatic disbursal of the loan. The financial institution will honour its commitment after carrying out due diligence, which means you have to meet the institution\u2019s guidelines for home loan. Once you do so, you will have no fear of the loan being rejected and you can go ahead and make plans for your dream property.   var a = \"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/adx?iu=/7176/Economictimes/ET_Tracker/ET_Tracker_IMP_20&sz=1x1&d_imp=1&d_imp_hdr=1&c=\"; var randomnm = Math.random(); document.getElementById('trackfrm').src = a + randomnm.toString();  ", "published_date": "May 15, 2019, 04.37 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:51:57", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/a-ready-reckoner-on-pre-approved-home-loans/articleshow/69340391.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Government clears scheme to rebate central, state embedded taxes for textiles sector</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet Thursday approved a scheme for rebate of all state and central embedded levies for apparel and made-up textile segments, which would make shipments zero-rated, thereby boosting the country's competitiveness in export markets.  Addressing a press conference here, Textiles Secretary Raghvendra Singh said the decision was needed as incentives for apparel and made-ups under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) were not WTO compatible anymore.  \"The MEIS scheme offered 4 per cent support which was not available beyond December 31,\" Singh told reporters.  He said rates under the Remission of State Levies (RoSL) have been revised upwards for garments and made-ups, and centrally embedded levies outside the ambit of GST have been added to the scheme, which will \"more than offset\" incentives not available under MEIS for apparel and made-ups.  The decision assumes significance as shipments from neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam enjoy zero duty access to the EU, which is the biggest export market for India's apparel sector.  \"However, our exports to the European Union have to face a tariff disparity of around 9.6 per cent. We were facing acute competition in this business where profitability is quite marginal,\" Singh said.  The made-up segment of textiles includes products like bedsheets, blankets and curtains.  \"Our endeavour will also be to extend these benefits to exports of fibre, yarn and fabrics. A committee will be set up to examine if similar incentives can be extended to these segments,\" Singh said.  According to him, the revenue foregone estimate due to the decision has been pegged at Rs 6,300 annually.  The inter ministerial committee as well as the norms committee of the Department of Commerce shall from time to time assess the impact of this decision and tweak it wherever needed, Singh said.  Currently, Remission of State Levies (RoSL), which is to offset indirect taxes levied by states such as stamp duty, petroleum tax , electricity duty and mandi tax that were embedded in exports, is provided to textiles exporters.  \"The decision which also extends rebate up to March 31, 2020, will greatly benefit apparel & made-ups manufacturers/exporters,\" Textiles Minister Smriti Irani said in a tweet.  She said the apparel and made-ups have a combined share of 55 per cent (around USD 21 billion) in the total Indian textile export basket and the decision to enhance rebate will have a direct impact on these segments, thereby increasing competitiveness of India's textile exports globally.  The decision also entails change in disbursal mechanism whereby the rebate of all embedded state and central levies will be done through the Scrip System.  \"Fulfilling one of the primary demands of the industry, Rebate of State and Centre Levies/Taxes will be done through IT-driven Scrip System thereby preventing delay & ensuring speedy disbursal,\" Irani said in another tweet.  The decision will enable the government to take various measures for making exports of apparel and made-ups zero rated.  \"The proposed measures are expected to make the textile sector competitive. Rebate of all embedded state and central taxes/levies for apparel and made-ups segments would make exports zero-rated, thereby boosting India's competitiveness in export markets and ensure equitable and inclusive growth of textile and apparel sector,\" an official statement said.  A senior official said under RoSL, in apparel, previously there was a maximum rate of 1.7 per cent which has been revised to a maximum of 3.6 per cent.  The rate of central levies on apparel was a maximum of 2.45 per cent which means effectively the rate on apparel has gone up from 1.7 per cent to 6.05 per cent.  The official said for made-ups, previously the maximum RoSL rate was 2.2 per cent which has been revised to 5 per cent, plus central levies with a maximum rate of 3.2 per cent, taking the overall rate from 2.2 per cent to 8.2 per cent.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Bidi smoking cost India Rs 80,550 crore last year: Study</h1>", "description": "KOCHI: Ill health and early deaths caused by smoking ' bidi ' cost India Rs 80,550 crore in 2017 alone, a study has found.  Bidi -- a cheap cigarette made of unprocessed tobacco wrapped in leaves -- is very popular in India, accounting for 81 per cent of the tobacco smoked and 72 million regular users over the age of 15.  The poor already bear the brunt of these costs, and unhindered use of bidi tobacco threatens to push even more households into poverty, according to the study published in the journal Tobacco Control.  According to researchers from Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) in Kerala, bidi contains less tobacco than conventional cigarettes, the nicotine content is significantly higher. The relatively low burn point forces smokers to breathe in more of the harmful chemicals produced.  Bidi smoking is implicated in several types of cancer, tuberculosis, and various long term lung conditions. But despite its impact on the nation's health, it has been taxed at a rate that is a fraction of that applied to cigarettes.  The financial toll taken by bidi smoking in India has never been calculated. To try and put this right, the researcher drew on several sources of national and international data to estimate the direct and indirect costs of treating the ill health and early deaths attributable to the habit among 30-69 year olds in 2017.  The calculations showed that bidi smoking cost India Rs 80550 crore in terms of ill health and early deaths.  Direct costs-tests, drugs, doctors' fees, hospital stays, and transport-make up around a fifth of this total (Rs 16870 crore), with the remainder made up of indirect costs-accommodation for relatives/carers and loss of household income (Rs 81,120 crore).  Given that around one in four 30 to 69 year old men smokes bidi, the habit takes a disproportionate toll on the nation's men, says the researcher.  These figures amount to around 0.5 per cent of the goods and services (GDP) India produces and more than two per cent of its total health spend, he calculates. Yet the tax revenue derived from bidi smoking came to just Rs 417 crore in 2016-17.  Nearly one in five households in India faces \"catastrophic expenditures\" due to healthcare costs, the researcher points out, with more than 63 million people pushed into poverty, as a result.  \"Diseases associated with bidi smoking add to this, potentially pushing more people into poverty,\" said Rijo M John, CPPR suggesting that about 15 million face poverty because of spending on tobacco and associated health costs.  \"Expenditure on tobacco also crowds out expenditure on food and education in India, especially among the poor,\" John said.  \"Despite overwhelming evidence on the effectiveness of taxing tobacco products, taxation as a tool to regulate bidi smoking has been highly underutilised in India,\" he added, calling for for a tax hike on bidi tobacco to halt its unfettered consumption.  \"Allowing bidi consumption to continue unhindered would make income distribution even more regressive, as the poor will continue to bear a disproportionately large share of economic costs from bidi smoking due to their higher bidi smoking prevalence,\" he said.

While the bankrupt operator may have narrowly escaped liquidation, its financial creditors may recover 15-20% of loans they extended to Aircel , among the lowest in major insolvency cases so far. \u201cLenders can recover 15-20% of their investments, which is a sweet deal in the given circumstances,\u201d said a person aware of the development. \u201cThe asset reconstruction company will take the business as a going concern and run the smaller businesses like bulk SMS and enterprise. The rest of the assets will be sold and that money too will go to the lenders. The recovery will take 12-36 months.\u201d  UVARCL has offered Rs 150 crore upfront and additional proceeds from the successful running of the bulk SMS and enterprise businesses, another person said.  Lenders may have to be satisfied with recovering Rs 2,968-Rs 3,957 crore of the money lent to the telco, a figure that Deloitte , the resolution professional, verified as Rs 19,788.77 crore.  \u201cWe have not received any communication in this regard and we have no comments to offer,\u201d said UVARCL. However, people aware said the development has been verbally communicated. Deloitte did not respond to ET\u2019s queries.  UVARCL was set up in 2007 and counts Central Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Union Bank of India, Bank of India, United Bank of India, Allahabad Bank , United India Insurance Company and National Insurance Company as major stakeholders. It will now take over the reins from Deloitte.  The debt resolution of Aircel, majority owned by Malaysia\u2019s Maxis Communications , was conducted by Deloitte\u2019s Vijay Iyer for a year.  Last month, it proposed the ARC\u2019s name to the committee of creditors, which had a month to respond. Aircel\u2019s biggest lenders include State Bank of India, China Development Bank and Punjab National Bank .  According to claims approved, SBI should have ideally received about Rs 7,246 crore, CDB Rs 2,719 crore and PNB about Rs 2,986 crore. The three banks did not respond to ET\u2019s queries.  \u201cThis will be one of the biggest haircuts in a big-ticket insolvency. The banks will now onwards have to increase their provisioning amount in order to take the hit of any further insolvencies,\u201d said Manoj Kumar, head of M&A and insolvency at Corporate Professionals.  ET was the first to report that UVARCL was the name proposed to the lenders by Deloitte.  The ARC will run certain operations of Aircel and put up assets including real estate, towers and spectrum for sale. Aircel, which ran mobile services across India and was particularly strong in the south, stopped services in March 2018.    It voluntarily filed for bankruptcy after coming under pressure due to competition and the burden of debt taken to acquire airwaves and fund expansion.  The bankruptcy court, while admitting the pleas of Aircel and its Dishnet Wireless and Aircel Cellular units, noted that its enterprise business, along with the company\u2019s spectrum, towers, fibre network and other assets, were worth Rs 32,000 crore.  The company made several efforts to raise funds to escape liquidation. Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm were said to have put in bids for the assets.

In value terms, the paint industry grew by approx. 8 per cent to Rs. 43,500 crores of which the decorative paints share was 74 per cent and the balance being industrial.  The per capita consumption of paints in India has been estimated to be 3.23 kgs during 2015-16, which is much lower in comparison to some of the other developed economies around the world providing immense opportunities for growth for the paint industry. Mr Jalaj Dani, President, The Indian Paint Association and President- HR, Chemicals & Supply Chain, Asian Paints Ltd . said this at the 53rd AGM of the Association.  \u201cThe growth in industrial paint category is dependent on the performance of the automotive industry consuming around 45 per cent of the industrial paints. The slowdown in the auto segment has adversely impacted the industrial paints business in 2015-16. According to data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers the auto industry had registered a marginal growth of 2.58 per cent in production in 2015-16 over the previous year,\u201d he said.  However, according to him, the paint industry over decades has always witnessed a growth equivalent to 1.5 times the GDP growth of the country. \u201cThe Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister\u2019s Make in India\u201d vision has been rated as the most appropriate and much needed initiative to give boost to the manufacturing sector of the country. Coupled with Ease of Doing Business initiative by DIPP, Make in India offers multifarious benefits to the potential investors and strengthens the country to compete as one of the top investment destination globally,\u201d he said.  Addressing the Public Session of the IPA AGM, Mr Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Union Minister of State (IC) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship , said the Central Government is keen to support the country\u2019s paint industry.  The Minister appreciated the role being played by the Indian Paint Association and the Paints and Coatings Skill Council towards top-notch skill development. He reiterated his Ministry\u2019s firm resolve to realize Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi\u2019s vision to make India the world\u2019s skill capital. What touched a chord with the leaders of the Indian Paint Association at the CII Centre of Excellence for Leadership at Salt Lake was the strong case the Minister made for skill development for all strata of society.  At the IPA AGM, Mr Rudy also launched the Paints and Coatings Skill Council (PCSC) newsletter and released a promotional video and the first set of training videos capturing its skill development agenda. PCSC will soon commence its training programmes across the nation through its affiliated training partners.

In its fourth quarter earnings release, the Kolkata-based company said despite accounting for such a low share of overall tobacco consumption in the country, the legal cigarette industry contributes more than 87% of tax revenue from tobacco. ITC said the tax on cigarettes has nearly trebled over the last six years whereby the taxation is about 50 times higher than other tobacco products.  ITC said the exchequer is losing more than Rs 13,000 crore revenue annually on account of tax evasion on cigarettes which is even higher when the evaded taxes on other tobacco products are also considered.  While the legitimate cigarette industry has declined steadily since 2010-11 at a compound annual rate of 4.8% per annum, illegal cigarette volumes have grown at about 5% per annum during the same period, the company said.  The cigarette industry was further impacted last year by the sharp upward revision in goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess whereby tax on cigarettes rose sharply by 13% with an even steeper increase of 19% for the king-size filter segment. Coupled with the increase in excise duty rates announced in last year budget , this resulted in an incremental tax burden of over 20% on the cigarette business post implementation of GST .

Highways, roads, bridges and housing will take the lead in the usage of drones, the ECI-PwC report 'Flying high: Drones to drive jobs in the construction sector' said.  The report, based on secondary data on best practices of drone in the construction industry globally, including India, said drones can eliminate redundancies and bring in efficiency and they have a role to play at every step of the construction lifecycle.  The reason for the growth of the construction sector is that it is the fastest-growing adopter of commercial drones, according to the report.  Adoption of drones is surging at 239 per cent in this sector as builders deploy drones on job sites around the world to enhance safety, document and understand the progress at sites, enable precise planning, generate 3D maps and identify potential issues before they begin costing dearly, it said.  It can also also be used for ensuring successful prevention of accidents is periodical inspection of construction sites, the report added.  On a construction project, where new hazards are a recurrent feature, UAVs and drones can be deployed to conduct safer, faster and more accurate inspections instead of safety managers physically conducting site 'walk-throughs' to identify potential hazards, the report said.

In the railways segment, besides the core capex, the station redevelopment and the recently announced bullet train project is expected to provide significant opportunities to the construction companies, the agency said.  Similarly, in the road sector, adequate pipeline of projects for development and upgradation of the national highways and state highways exists.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana project itself is expected to provide large opportunities for the construction sector as it is the largest road development programme in India with a planned investment of Rs 5.35 trillion.  \"With a huge pipeline of projects to be awarded in the infrastructure sector, the new order inflows for construction companies are expected to remain healthy. However, there can be a slowdown in the pace of order tendering in the months closer to the Lok Sabha general elections due to be held in April/May this year,\" Icra said.  Besides this, delays in land acquisition also remains a risk to new order inflows, particularly in the transportation infrastructure sector.  Icra also noted that order inflows from non- infrastructure segments like industrial and real estate (excluding affordable housing segment) is expected to remain muted, with weak private sector capex growth.  \"On the execution front, being an election year, strong focus is expected on execution which, along with healthy order-book should support growth in operating income of construction companies in the first half of calendar year 2019, though it could witness moderation post elections till stabilisation of new government at the Centre,\" it said.

In 2017-18 exports declined by 4 per cent to USD 16.7 billion. \"Country's apparel exports have taken a beating from October 2017 onwards. The introduction of GST has resulted in non-refund of several embedded taxes. Consequently exports for the financial year 2017-18 declined by 4 per cent to USD 16.7 billion from 17.38 billion in the previous year,\" the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India ( CMAI ) president Rahul Mehta told reporters here.

Commenting on domestic apparel market, Mehta said, country's domestic apparel market is estimated at USD 67 billion, which has grown at a CAGR of 10 per cent since 2005. Indian domestic market has performed better than the largest consumption regions like US, EU and Japan, where depressed economic conditions led to lower demand and growth.  Due to presence of strong fundamentals, the domestic apparel market size of India is expected to grow at 11-12 per cent CAGR and reach about USD 160 billion by 2025.

Foreign direct investment norms for the sector may also be relaxed.  Products on which imports duties are expected to increase includes some fabrics, garments and man-made fibres. The duties could be enhanced to 20 per cent from the current level of about 5-10 per cent.  According to government sources, the Finance Ministry may soon issue a notification in this regard.  If the government decides to notify the duty hikes this week, then it would have to be first tabled in Parliament.  Increase in duties would give an edge to domestic manufacturers as the imported products are relatively cheaper. Increase in manufacturing activity will help create jobs in the sector, which employs about 10.5 crore people.  In July, the government doubled import duty on over 50 textile products -- including jackets, suits and carpets -- to 20 per cent, a move that is aimed at promoting domestic manufacturing.  Through a notification, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Custom (CBIC) had hiked import duties as well as raised the ad-valorem rate of duty for certain items.  The imported products which have become expensive include woven fabrics, dresses, trousers, suits and baby garments.  According to trade experts, India would not be able to give any direct exports incentive to the textile sector , so there is a need to support the segment to encourage domestic manufacturing.  Imports of textile yarn, fabric, made-up articles grew by 8.58 per cent to USD 168.64 million in June.  However, exports of cotton yarn/fabrics/made-ups, handloom products grew by 24 per cent to USD 986.2 million. Man-made yarn/fabrics/made-ups exports grew 8.45 pc to USD 403.4 million.

This inverted structure has made it easier to import synthetic textiles , (rather) than manufacture them domestically,\u201d said Sanjay Jain, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI).  \u201cRefund of inverted duty is allowed, but it is complicated and leads to working capital blockage for months. Goods and services tax (GST) on capital goods is not refunded,\u201d Jain added.  Export of manmade yarn, fabrics and made-ups dropped 3% on-year in November, to $371million. As per industry estimates, the inverted duty structure made imports 15-20% cheaper for the domestic industry.  Sales of manmade textiles such as polyester and viscose,\u201d said another industry representative, requesting anonymity.  Another grouse of the industry is that rules do not allow refund or adjustment of goods and services tax on services from output GST obligations, which has led to losses for small and medium enterprises using job working services and having an inverted duty structure.  \u201cIt is incorrectly framed and the refund rule needs to be rectified,\u201d said Jain of CITI. To resolve the issue, the industry has sought refund for unused input tax credit that lapsed on July 31last year and extension of the refund to those selling in the domestic market.

EY and a previously appointed resolution professional for RCom are among the firms interviewed by the state-run lender, according to people in the know.  SBI is considering initiating an independent application to take RCom to the National Company Law Tribunal though the debt-ridden company had informed stock exchanges on February 4 that it had decided to submit itself to NCLT as it was unable to pay its debts. The lender also has the option of waiting for RCom to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on its own and then recommending an RP of its choice once the committee of creditors is convened, according to sources. RCom owes banks close to Rs 40,000 crore.   NCLT Had Approved RBSA as RP  \u201cIt is a policy of the bank not to comment upon individual accounts and its treatment,\u201d said an SBI spokesperson in response to emailed queries.  Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson had dragged RCom to NCLT in May last year on the grounds that the telecom firm had not paid Rs 550 crore in dues for equipment supplied to it.    NCLT had approved the appointment of consulting firm RBSA as the resolution professional for RCom and two of its subsidiaries \u2014 Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom \u2014 at the time.  RCom later got a stay on the insolvency proceedings by promising to repay Ericsson\u2019s dues within a stipulated time frame at the national company law appellate tribunal (NCLAT). Earlier this year, after its proposed deal with Reliance Jio fell through, RCom sought to withdraw its application from the NCLAT, but this was opposed by the Swedish equipment maker.  The dispute between the two parties is now being adjudicated upon by the Supreme Court.  RCom has been unsuccessful in repaying creditors despite numerous attempts at settlements. The proposed deal to sell spectrum to Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio that would have helped the company shed some of its debt has also failed to make headway.  RCom stopped wireless telephony services to customers in late 2017 and said it would only focus on its B2B offerings to reduce costs.

The extension is being sought a month after the bid deadline expired on March 8, to accommodate the interests of TPG Capital, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Blackstone-backed International Asset Reconstruction Company (IARC). The said players have shown fresh interest in the asset and are likely to bid if NCLT allows the extension, said two people aware of the development. A hearing is scheduled to take place on April 10.  ACCIL owes Rs 5,000 crore to lenders whereas JSW Steel has offered Rs 1,200 crore for the asset that includes Rs 800 crore for secured lenders and Rs 400 crore for unsecured lenders. Accepting this bid will lead to the creditors taking a 76% haircut which is why the RP and CoC may want to apply for an extension and go for a fresh round of bidding, one of the people said. The 270-day deadline for the company\u2019s resolution expires on April 16.  To be sure, out of the three players, only Kotak Mahindra Bank had submitted an initial expression of interest (EoI). The other two have shown fresh interest in the company; this could raise a concern as when a second round of bids were being called for Essar Steel, only the players that had submitted EoIs were allowed to bid.  A senior JSW Steel official said that the company has no information about the extension for the bid deadline \u201cbut for any asset under resolution in IBC, processes laid down need to be followed as such extensions when they take place a month after the bid deadline would be challenged on multiple levels surpassing the 270-day deadline.\u201d  TPG Capital and the RP Kuldip Kumar Bassi declined to comment. Mails sent to Kotak Mahindra Bank and IARC did not elicit a response till the time of going to press.

This will encourage professionals who find huge career opportunity in this new-age profession that plays a crucial role in the fight against bad loans .  At the same time, this could end the corporates\u2019 delay tactics by levelling false allegations against the RPs.  \u201cIf there was any lapse on the part of the resolution professional which has come to the notice of the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT), he should have referred the matter to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) for taking appropriate action in accordance with law,\u201d Judges SJ Mukhopadhaya and AIS Cheema said in their order.  IBBI is the competent authority to take any action, after seeking explanation from the RP, they said.

The matter relates to Dhinal Shah, an RP in the bankruptcy proceedings against shipbuilder Bharati Defence and Infrastructure, which defaulted repayments.

In 2017-18 exports declined by 4 per cent to USD 16.7 billion. \"Country's apparel exports have taken a beating from October 2017 onwards. The introduction of GST has resulted in non-refund of several embedded taxes. Consequently exports for the financial year 2017-18 declined by 4 per cent to USD 16.7 billion from 17.38 billion in the previous year,\" the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India ( CMAI ) president Rahul Mehta told reporters here.  The downturn continued in FY 2018-19 with a month on month decline of 8-10 per cent and it is expected to witness overall decline by 10 per cent in FY19, Mehta said.  The country exports nearly 70 per cent of cotton garments and 20 per cent jump in cotton prices in last few months has also hit exports severly, he said.  The industry is having talks with the textile ministry and the government has assured that embedded taxes will be refunded through the drawback route.  Commenting on domestic apparel market, Mehta said, country's domestic apparel market is estimated at USD 67 billion, which has grown at a CAGR of 10 per cent since 2005. Indian domestic market has performed better than the largest consumption regions like US, EU and Japan, where depressed economic conditions led to lower demand and growth.  Due to presence of strong fundamentals, the domestic apparel market size of India is expected to grow at 11-12 per cent CAGR and reach about USD 160 billion by 2025.  The domestic market size is dominated by ready-to-wear category, market size USD 56 billion, with 84 per cent share which is further growing at a CAGR of 10-11 per cent.

It has asked the government to not cut or eliminate import duties in this sector under the proposed mega trade deal Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ).  A report from PwC and CEAMA has asked the government to \"consider excluding ACE products from the future FTAs, especially RCEP.\"  India has signed FTAs with several countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and ASEAN.  Under an FTA , each country is required to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate tariff rates on the other country's goods, which also include electronic goods as per a pre-decided timeline for implementation.  According to Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), the ACE sector has witnessed a flat growth in the first half of the ongoing fiscal on account of devaluation of Indian rupee and other factors.  The report said: \"FTAs signed by India are with production-driven economies resulting in finished products from these countries being imported into India at a cost lower than what it would have cost to manufacture the same products in India.\"  \"This factor combined with the fact that in most cases, components of the finished products are subject to import duties at rates higher than the duties applicable on finished products, the FTA has contributed to the decline of the manufacturing of products in India.\"  The report also suggested to provide subsidies to locally manufactured products to help them compete with fully finished goods imported at zero duty under the current FTA agreement.  India should focus on signing FTAs with consumption driven economies to promote export and focus on \u2018Make in India' for the world, the report said.  It suggested to treat the entire consumer electronics segment as a single category under GST to ensure uniformity in GST rate and provide incentives in the form of subsidies to consumers to encourage them to shift to higher star-rated energy efficient appliances.  The report also recommended incentivisation of R&D undertaken in India to build domestic capability to make components that are currently unavailable in India.  \"Also some consumer durables are considered luxury products from a GST perspective. With changing lifestyle patterns and consumer aspirations, such products have now become a necessity that warrant revisiting the tax structure and rates,\" it added.

Smaller accountancy firms in the country want Indian regulators to implement the radical proposals, such as operationally splitting the Big Four\u2019s audit and non-audit businesses and mandatory joint audits, put forth in Competitions and Markets Authority\u2019s report, the sources said.  Market regulators across the globe have been keenly anticipating the CMA report because it examined globally relevant contentious issues such as the oligopolistic structure of the audit market and inherent conflict of interest amongst audit and non-audit businesses of the firms.  In India, too, the Big Four firms are in the spotlight after corporate failures like IL&FS and Jet Airways. The CMA report called for a separate management, CEO and board for the audit practice, besides a separate bonus and compensation structure.  It also suggested mandatory joint audits with non-Big Four firms because the current structure of the industry heavily favoured Big Four firms and restricted choice.  The report also highlighted a need for more robust regulatory oversight of the audit committees to make them more accountable. Over the years, the audit market has consolidated from Big Eight firms to Big Four and experts feel that the market structure limits choice and is not resilient.  Implementing the Competitions and Markets Authority\u2019s proposals will help increase choice in the market, end the Big Four oligopoly , and fix other longstanding problems, their smaller rivals said.  \u201cIndian regulators can start joint audits with Nifty 50 and then extend based on their experience,\u201d said Vishesh Chandiok, CEO at Grant Thornton India.  \u201cThe report recommendations present an immensely progressive view of how to finally address the \u2018demand side\u2019 problems in the large audit market that will spread from the UK to other major markets and address this issue of auditor choice once and for all. It\u2019s definitely the end of this long standing oligopoly and finally moving towards a free and transparent market,\u201d he said.  All solutions proposed for these issues until now had stopped short of addressing how to create demand for challenger firms outside the big firms and little was done to focus on audit quality, top executives in smaller firms said. They believe supply side barriers on capability and capacity are not difficult to build if there was demand.  Non-Big Four accounting firms in India have seen their market share erode over the last two decades due to dominance of the big firms.  Experts said deeper reforms such as mandating joint audits are needed to fix quality issues. \u201cIf joint audit is being introduced, this would redefine the way audits would be delivered by audit firms,\u201d said Milind Kothari, CEO at BDO India.

Appearing on behalf of Standard Chartered , which is seeking to be treated at par with the secured financial creditor for its claim of Rs 3,500 crore, Sibal said bankers have clubbed Orissa Slurry Pipeline Ltd with Essar Steel in the auction to recover unpaid loans.  Orissa Slurry Pipeline Ltd, he said, is a separate entity owned by SREI Infrastructure and Essar Steel, and was not part of the original offer to sell Essar Steel. Clubbing it with Essar Steel in the sale would benefit Lakshmi Mittal-run firm.  Sibal argued that acceptance of Rs 39,500 crore as the bid amount by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel, to which Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) was not part, is contrary to the undertaking given by ArcelorMittal to the Supreme Court.  He alleged that the truncated CoC of four members privately negotiated with ArcelorMittal to get a Slurry Pipeline, which is not even an asset of Essar Steel.  An amount of Rs 2,500 crore, which should have been paid to Standard Chartered, has been diverted to lenders of Odisha Slurry Pipeline India Ltd, which owns the slurry pipeline.  Such private negotiations should not have been undertaken by the four members of the CoC, which are to the detriment of the stakeholders of Essar Steel and concern assets of a different company altogether, he said.  Standard Chartered had filed a plea in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) opposing a decision by a lower court to sell Essar Steel to ArcelorMittal as it stands to lose a substantial part of loans it had extended to Essar. Standard Chartered is to get just 1.7 per cent of its outstanding claims while the financial creditors were recovering close to 92 per cent of their claims from the sale proceeds.  Sibal also questioned the authority of the CoC to distribute money received from the auction of Essar Steel saying it was only empowered to approve or reject a resolution plan.  He protested that Standard Chartered was not allowed to be present and become part of voting at the CoC, which comprised lenders for slurry pipeline project also.  SCB also argued that profits made by Essar Steel during the insolvency period were being misappropriated by ArcelorMittal. Such funds are otherwise required to be distributed amongst creditors.  The NCLAT directed a day-to-day hearing of the case and posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday when Sibal will continue his arguments.  ArcelorMittal sought time for its senior counsel Harish Salve to appear on its behalf on May 20 or May 24.  The NCLAT had last week sought a response from ArcelorMittal on a petition filed by a majority shareholder of Essar Steel seeking rejection of the Rs 42,000 crore bid alleging that its promoter Lakshmi Mittal hid his association with loan defaulting firms run by his brothers.  Seeking ArcelorMittal be declared ineligible to bid for Essar Steel, the petition had cited Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which bars promoters of defaulting companies from bidding for stressed assets.  The NCLAT had agreed to hear the plea by Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd (ESAHL) and asked ArcelorMittal to respond to the plea.  Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd (ESAHL) holds 72 per cent shares of Essar Steel.  The plea came weeks after an insolvency court cleared ArcelorMittal's bid for Essar Steel, which was auctioned by lenders to recover unpaid loans.  It alleged that Mittal was a promoter of GPI Textiles Ltd, Balasore Alloys Ltd and Gontermann Piepers (India) Ltd - firms run by his brothers Pramod and Vinod Mittal that have been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans by banks.", "published_date": "May 13, 2019, 06.53 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:52:27", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/arcelor-paying-rs-39500-crore-for-essar-steel-and-not-rs-42000-cr-scb-counsel-kapil-sibal/articleshow/69310602.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Large electronic products posted higher growth since 2014, revealed data from UK-based researcher Euromonitor International.  According to annual growth data for the past 10 years by WPP-owned research agency Kantar Worldpanel and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), while the actual consumer demand or volume growth for FMCG products and passenger vehicles rose consistently since 2014, growth either faltered or declined in most segments over the past two years following the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in July 2017, patchy monsoon rain and a higher base, which in turn, dragged down the average growth rate.  For instance, the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market grew 3.1% on average for five years starting 2014 despite a decline of 1.1% last year. In comparison, the consumer goods segment grew 4% in 2009-13.  \u2018Rural Growth Aided Sales under UPA-2\u2019  \u201cPolicy decisions such as GST or demonetisation (November 2016) caused short-term disruption in consumption growth but will boost demand over a longer period,\u201d said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products .  \u201cAlso, growth during previous years had a consistent government regime, which helped stability while the current term\u2019s initiatives in creating infrastructure or new policies will reflect on growth only after a few years.\u201d  Demonetisation and the rollout of the single producer levy had upended consumption and stocking patterns across the consumer goods segment.

It should be noted that auto industry data is for the relevant financial years while that for other consumer segments relate to calendar years.  During the second term of the UPA government (2009-14), overall FMCG growth also stemmed from rising rural disposable incomes, following three consecutive years of good agricultural growth and the jobs programme. However, two straight years of deficient monsoon rain starting 2014 stalled growth in the rural markets, home to more than 800 million people whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output. It was followed by long periods of low food inflation that depressed rural consumption since mid-2015, say experts.  A recent report by Citi research said a modest reversal in food prices could help rural consumption growth and the effectiveness of welfare schemes will be crucial. \u201cWith subdued agriculture activity and depressed rural wages, revival of these programmes post-election would be a key factor for rural consumption growth. The success of these programmes in lifting rural demand after the elections would critically depend upon budgetary support and ability to remove local bottlenecks,\u201d the report said.   AUTO GROWTH  The average annual growth rate under the NDA regime for cars and two-wheelers was 6.2% and 7.2%, compared with 11.8% and 13.8% in the UPA\u2019s second term. That was thanks to healthy rural incomes and pay commission implementation with the auto industry insulated from the effects of the global financial crisis due to a stimulus programme.  While the second term of the UPA government was a tale of two extremes, the current NDA regime has been all about steady organic growth through various disruptions, said Aswin Kumar, programme manager, mobility (automotive and transportation) at Frost & Sullivan.    \u201cThe recent slowdown has been triggered by increase in cost of ownership due to liquidity crunch, insurance and fuel price hikes, some of which may not be under government control,\u201d Kumar said.  With about 15 million cars and 50 million two-wheelers added in five and seven years, respectively, traffic congestion has surged. Meanwhile, the rise of shared mobility platforms such as Uber and Ola have provided alternate means of transport, impacting car purchases. Maruti Suzuki, which controls half the car market in the country, saw sales slow in FY19 after four consecutive years of double-digit growth.  \u201cRural growth has sustained even as there has been slowdown in some urban areas,\u201d said Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava. \u201cThe current government has addressed some fundamental issues and there are a number of policies being put in place to deliver long-term growth.\u201d GST and simplification of the tax regime will have a long-term positive impact on the automotive sector, he said.  While rural markets dragged the consumer products market down, companies said changes in taxation and government initiatives over the past five years have triggered faster growth in electronics under the NDA government versus the previous UPA term. For instance, televisions grew 10% while washing machines and refrigerators rose 11.5% since 2014 on average compared with a decline of 4% in televisions and 10% growth in each of the other two large appliance groups.  The drive toward rural electrification and improvement in infrastructure has helped, said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi. \u201cThe government last year reduced GST on appliances like refrigerators, washing machines and small televisions from 28% to 18%, whereby the net taxation reduced from 25% earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reduced net prices driving consumption.\u201d ", "published_date": "Apr 12, 2019, 08.16 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:52:34", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/durables/auto-groceries-skid-under-nda-white-goods-shine/articleshow/68842234.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

In the wake of crisis-hit Jet Airways suspending operations, the ministry decided to allocate the vacant slots at the airports in the national capital and Mumbai to other carriers. The move is part of larger efforts to increase capacity amid recent surge in airfares.  According to the source, the minister has asked Civil Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola for a report on the Jet Airways' slots that have been allocated to other airlines so far. The report is to be submitted by May 11.  The development also comes against the backdrop of concerns raised in certain quarters about the process being followed in temporary allocation of Jet Airways' slots.  The slots are being given to other airlines on an interim basis and decisions are taken by a committee set up by the ministry.  Jet Airways has more than 440 slots at Mumbai and Delhi airports , a ministry official said last month.  As per the source, the minister has asked the secretary to ensure that all slot allocations have been made on an interim basis by following all applicable guidelines in a transparent manner.  The source also said the minister has directed that a final decision on allocation of Jet Airways slots should not be taken till conclusion of the resolution plan that is being worked out by the airline's lenders.  The State Bank of India-led consortium of domestic lenders to Jet Airways has already sought bids for the ailing airline, which shuttered operations on April 17 after it ran out of cash.  The list of final bidders is likely to be finalised this week.  On Wednesday, Jet Airways gave a clarification to the stock exchanges regarding reports that Atmosphere Airlines has submitted an expression of interest along with Naresh Goyal and four other companies.  \"The bidding process is initiated by and managed by SBI Capital Markets Ltd under a resolution plan undertaken by a consortium of domestic lenders led by State Bank of India.  \"The company is not involved in the bidding process and has no information with regard to same and is accordingly not in a position to comment,\" the airline said in a filing.  Naresh Goyal is the founder of Jet Airways.  Earlier on Wednesday, Goyal's daughter Namrata Goyal said that her father is not part of any consortium.  \"I'm Naresh Goyal's daughter and this is to clarify that hes not part of any consortium and this information is completely misleading and mischievous (sic),\" she said in a tweet.

The government's stand assumes significance as lenders negotiate with key stakeholders of the airline to take forward the proposal to convert a part of the company's loans into shares and iron out differences over the plan.  Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Minister Prabhu told IANS: \"The Government is closely watching the situation\".  When asked about any requisite approvals that the proposed deal between bankers, management and shareholders including Etihad Airways might require from the ministry, he said that appropriate action will be taken, if required.  Mandate wise, the ministry is responsible for the safe operations of the airline and to monitor, if the substantial ownership and effective control norms are being met.  The minister added that the government has set proper mechanisms to monitor airline's adherence to flight schedules as passed by the DGCA.  Currently, owing to its strained financial position, the airline has been forced to ground over 25 aircraft due to non-payments of dues.  This has effected over 85 flights.  To relive the airline of its financial constraints, the State Bank of India (SBI), which leads a consortium of lenders is negotiating with key stakeholders of the airline to take the proposal -- Bank-led Provisional Resolution Plan -- forward.  Last month, Jet's shareholders had approved the BLPRP, as part of which, public sector lenders will become the largest equity owners of the airline, virtually making it a nationalised carrier.  The shareholders' approval came after Jet Airways Board approved the BLPRP on February 14.  \"The BLPRP currently estimates a funding gap of Rs 8,500 crore (including proposed repayment of aircraft debt of Rs 1,700 crore) to be met by appropriate mix of equity infusion, debt restructuring, sale or sale and leaseback or refinancing of aircraft, among other things,\" the company said in a regulatory filing to the BSE on February 14.  As part of a provisional resolution plan, the airline's Board has agreed to allot 11.4 crore shares at an aggregate value of Re 1 to the lenders' consortium led by the State Bank of India, according to the airline.  Recently, Jet Airways reported Rs 587.7 crore as standalone net loss for the third quarter ended December 31, 2018. It had reported a net profit of Rs 165.25 crore during the year-ago period.  The private carrier on January 1 defaulted in paying interest and installments on loan repayments due to banks, following which rating agency ICRA downgraded both short and long-term credit facilities of the airline.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Higher cost of energy efficient white goods makes a dent on sales</h1>", "description": "Kolkata: Indian consumers are not buying high-energy-efficient refrigerators and air-conditioners after New Delhi revised the standards for household appliances, a revision that has pushed up prices of higher rated white-goods by 20-30%.  Sales of four- and five-star ACs have crashed by more than half in the last 15 months as compared to the same period before January 2018, data collated from industry body Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA) showed. New norms were introduced in January 2018 for this category, pushing up energy norms by two levels.  For refrigerators, sales of four- and five-star models started declining since 2015 when a revision was made. Subsequent tightening of norms in 2017 forced manufacturers to exit the five-star segment completely since last year due to no demand.  \u201cThe rating has done a lot of good to consumers and helped in the conservation of energy. But as the energy norms are tightened, they push up manufacturing costs and prices, whereby sales of higher-energy-efficient products are not realised to their full potential,\u201d said CEAMA president and Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi.  Leading retail chain Vijay Sales director Nilesh Gupta said the price difference between 3-star and 5-star AC models has doubled from Rs 4,000-5,000 to Rs 8,000-10,000, driving the shift. \u201cIn refrigerators, consumers prefer 3-star since they do not see much difference in energy consumption,\u201d he said.  As per industry data, 81% of AC sales are now for three-star energy rated models, compared with 58% two years ago. Sales of this category have been expanding at 18%. By contrast, the five-star model\u2019s contribution to total sales has dropped from 20% to 12% in the same period, with sales declining by 24%.  For refrigerators, four-star models were 45% of sales and five-star was 23% in 2016. These came down to 22% and nil, respectively, last year.  Three-star refrigerators now account for 46% of sales while two star models, which did not exist two years ago, now make up 26%. The power ministry-led Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), which formulates rating norms for household appliances in India, plans to continue tightening energy norms to set global benchmarks as appliances such as ACs are power guzzlers, said director general Abhay Bakre.  \u201cEven if consumers are buying three-star models, it is good enough since in 2017, these were the highest rated five-star. The rating change is done through a scientific and consultative process that will benefit consumers and create healthy competition to develop better products.  Once the market is transformed to higher energy-efficient models, the sales volume will lead to a reduction in their prices,\u201d Bakre said.  Nandi said the industry is in discussion with the government to link energy rating changes to certain percentage sales of the highest slab for each category. While rating norms for refrigerators and air-conditioners are scheduled to change next year, Bakre said five-star model norms may be postponed to 2021 if the technical committee believes the market is still not ready.  AC maker Blue Star\u2019s managing director B Thiagarajan said that energy norms in India for appliances are more stringent than in the US, Europe, Thailand, Middle-East and China. \u201cThe growth of appliances is driven by the aspirational middle class where affordability is a concern,\u201d he said.

The CoC of Essar Steel has divided operational creditors of the company into two types -- one with claims under Rs 1 crore and another above Rs 1 crore.  During the proceedings, the NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya said that the operational creditors cannot not be treated differentially.  \"We have said that you cannot discriminate among the same set of creditors. You can not discriminate among operational creditors on the basis of their dues,\" the NCLAT said.  According to the resolution plan of ArcelorMittal approved by CoC on October 24, 2018, operational creditors having claims below Rs 1 crore will get their dues and those with claims of over Rs 1 crore will receive almost zero.  Financial creditors would get an upfront Rs 41,987 crore payment against their admitted claims of Rs 49,395 crore while operational creditors are getting Rs 214 crore against their dues of Rs 4,976 crore.  Later, the CoC decided to allocate an additional Rs 1,000 crore to operational creditors after the NCLT and the NCLAT suggested it to rework on the distribution of funds.  According to advocate Anand Verma, who is representing operational creditors, the banks, which are financial creditors, are getting almost 90-92 per cent of their dues.  \"Moreover, the offer of additional Rs 1,000 crore given to the additional creditors has no meaning in law, as it requires equal treatment to financial and operational creditors,\" he said.  However, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing the CoC said that the Supreme Court in a judgement has said that financial creditors and operational creditors could not be treated at par.  The NCLAT would continue the hearing in the matter Wednersday.  According to a notice published earlier, the total dues of operational creditors with below Rs 1 crore claim is only around Rs 200 crore and the dues of operational creditors with above Rs 1 crore claim stood at Rs 4,900 crore.

The committee of creditors (CoC) is likely to meet over the weekend to discuss their next course of action.  The decision will be placed before the court in the next hearing on Monday.  \u201cThe comments of the judge which we have seen on the TV seem to suggest that operational creditors should get 10% of the total amount received from ArcelorMittal from the 5% suggested by us. We will have to consider it. But it is unlikely that we will agree.  The only hitch is that banks would like the money to come before the month-end and they may be under pressure to close it soon even if it is at a slightly lower value,\u201d said a banker with knowledge of the CoC\u2019s deliberations.  According to the proposal submitted by ArcelorMittal, financial creditors led by State Bank of India will get 92% of their dues which comes to around Rs 41,987 crore.  Operational creditors, under the plan, would have got just about 5%, or Rs 214 crore, against the outstanding dues of Rs 4,976 crore.  The two-judge bench of NCLAT has asked the CoC to consider giving operational creditors 10% of the total proceeds. If this suggestion is accepted, the total amount received by financial creditors would drop to Rs 37,800 crore.  The counsel representing the CoC opposed the proposal, saying they had approved the Arcelor-Mittal bid for Essar Steel based on the money they would be able to recover from the insolvency process.  The judge also favoured giving Standard Chartered more of the dues than what is proposed now, suggesting that a pro rata formula be applied for all financial creditors.  Such a decision would reduce the total amount that financial creditors will get to 85.6% of their dues from 92%.  Standard Chartered was to get just 1.7%, or Rs 60 crore of its Rs 3,500 crore dues, because unlike Indian banks, it had not lent to the parent company but its subsidiary and did not have first charge of its assets. The bench\u2019s proposal is to ensure that all operational creditors with dues of below Rs 1 crore get 100% of their money.

A Committee of Creditors (CoC) is scheduled to meet on May 9 to discuss the revised offer of NBCC Ltd after creditors, including bankers and home buyers, rejected the offer of Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty. NBCC's revised bid was not considered for voting by the lenders panel, citing lack of approvals from the government departments.  Meanwhile, Adani group has shown interest in making bid for Jaypee Infratech, while Jaypee group too has submitted bid for regaining control of its realty firm.  According to the revised offer submitted by NBCC, which was submitted to Jaypee Infratech's Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Anuj Jain, the public sector unit has proposed that the total operational debt aggregating to Rs 9,712 crore would be settled by payment of Rs 20 crore.  Among the operational creditors, the IT department has claimed Rs 3,334 crore, YEIDA Rs 6,112 crore and others Rs 267 crore. However, the IRP has admitted claims worth Rs 464 crore only out of total operational debt.  NBCC said that the liquidation value would not be sufficient to cover the amounts due to secured financial creditors in full. It further said that the liquidation value owed to the operational creditors is expected to be nil.  That apart, NBCC has also sought many relief and concessions including consent from the Yamuna Express Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) if Jaypee group transfers land and Yamuna Expressway to separate special purpose vehicles (SPVs).  On transfer of land to Jaypee Infratech from YEIDA as part of concession agreement, NBCC said the IT department has been making an addition to the income of about Rs 2,950 crore on annual basis, which could result in a tax demand of Rs 33,000 crore for a 30-year period.  NBCC has stated in its resolution plan that this liability in its entirety should be extinguished upon approval of this plan.  In its revised bid, the state-owned firm has proposed that it would infuse Rs 200 crore within three months to take over Jaypee Infratech, which is a subsidiary of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, the flagship firm of crisis-hit Jaypee group.  To secured financial creditors, NBCC has offered 950-acre land parcels worth Rs 5,000 crore and 100 per cent shareholding of Yamuna Expressway that connects Noida to Agra in Uttar Pradesh.  For the Yamuna Expressway, NBCC has proposed that the road asset should be transferred from Jaypee to a special purpose vehicle and debt could be raised against the toll income.  NBCC will settle the claims of the home buyers by ensuring delivery of over 20,000 flats. There are about 2,200 unsold flats with the Jaypee group worth Rs 1,800 crore.  On delay in paying penalty amounts to home buyers, the state-owned firm has proposed that the same would only be cleared if the Rs 750 crore deposited by Jaypee group with the registry of the Supreme Court is made available to it.

How has India been as a market for Omega in FY18-19? Would you still rank it at number 12 globally?  Worldwide, our company has seen a double-digit growth in 2018. While we cannot disclose the figures, interestingly, India has witnessed a higher growth than our global average last year.  Demonetisation and GST had been disturbing and affected the brand in the luxury space. We recovered in 2018 and have performed well. We predict similar growth in sales in 2019. Calamities and terror attacks can affect the economy but the first trimester has been comfortable.  India is still at number 12 for us. Since the sales growth has been higher than global percentage last year, India may jump to 11th or 10th rank by the end of 2019.   Which are the current top three markets in India? Will you expand to other cities?  Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru, in that order. We want to consolidate these markets now, retain the number of stores and increase our market share. It is our strategy for this year. We don\u2019t want to spread ourselves too thin.   Omega roped in 16-year-old international supermodel model Kaia Gerber as the new face of your 117-year-old brand. Do you observe a change in your company\u2019s customer profile?  The average age of our customer has dropped and the range has widened. It has shifted from 30-60 years to 25-65 years now in the recent times. We brought young model Kaia Gerber on board to attract younger clientele. We have invested more in social media promotions to attract the younger audience.  Our social media platform has many youngsters as followers now. We are still in infancy stage in India on social media and ecommerce platforms but we are taking baby steps to catch up with our international counterparts.   The industry is abuzz with smart watches and fashion timepieces. As a classic luxury brand with a high price tag, how do aim to keep your brand interesting for millennials who stay abreast on technology, trends and good deals?  Millennials have a different mindset but they still have emotion. A digital watch cannot give you emotion. A fashion watch is glitzy and it is good to see many brands offering products for the very young generation. Young consumers can change and wear fashion watches like socks on a daily basis.  However, a luxury mechanical watch has a heart inside with an engine. Our watches have both historic legacy and new technology, which hooks the millennials. Moreover, the consumer market today has a lot more businesswomen than ever. Women entrepreneurs want to make a statement. We will tap them apart from millennials.

The company, which mostly operates in the premium residential AC segment under brand Hitachi , is expecting to almost double the sales of its inverter range of ACs and around 50 per cent growth in sales of 5-star inverter ACs over the previous year.  Besides, Hitachi, which is expanding its channel network in tier-II and III markets, has also introduced new models designed specifically to cater to the first time and mid-segment AC buyers.  \"We will continue to be one of the top brands in the air conditioner segment. We expect to grow much faster than the market and achieve nearly 15 per cent growth (by value) this year,\" said Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh.  \"With this new brand identity, our growth addresses the inherent consumer needs and will be driven by a strong sales and marketing push in south and west markets this year,\" he said.  Hitachi had witnessed over 24 per cent year-on-year growth (y-o-y) in room AC last year against the industry growth of 7 per cent.  \"This growth was majorly driven by the company's focus towards providing energy efficiency and green products along with easy finance options. We are one of the top brands in India with a 12 per cent market share in the AC segment and intend to add a per cent or two by the end of 2019-20,\" he added.  The Indian residential AC market has witnessed almost flat growth in the past two years, but Singh expects a \"turnaround\" this year in the industry.  \"Given the timely onset of summer and the prediction of below-normal monsoon this year, we expect that the industry would see a double-digit growth over last year. Overall, higher disposable incomes, increasing electrification, changing weather conditions, growing urbanisation, year-round AC usage trend and easy access to financing schemes have been a few key factors driving the growth of AC sales in India,\" Singh added.  According to Singh, India is witnessing a continual shift towards inverter ACs, which now contributes around 40 per cent of the overall industry sales.  The company is investing around four per cent of its revenue into promoting the new brand through print, out-of-home, digital and other means of connecting with the consumers, he added.  \"Hitachi aims to reach every Indian household and become India's leading air conditioning brand by 2021,\" Singh said.  The Indian room AC industry market is expected to be of around 4.5 million unit with more than 20 companies competing in the space, in which Voltas and LG are leading the space.

On Monday, advocate Jitendra Kumar, representing the resolution professional (RP) of KSS Petron, said, the CoC had on February 7 decided to liquidate the firm. \u201cWe are seeking court\u2019s approval for the same,\u201d he added.  Mauritius-based Royal Partners (also known as RPMG Investments) has submitted a bid to buy the firm.  \u201cWe are challenging the rejection of our bid and also the constitution of CoC because one single lender owns over 99% in the firm and they are also related party in the matter,\u201d argued Royal Investment Partners\u2019 lawyer.  In an email, Mayur Ghule, managing director at RPMG Investments told ET that it has challenged the CoC ruling in the NCLT, without divulging other details.  Arcelor Mittal India, which owns around 99.76% voting power in the CoC, is also vying for Essar Steel. Lakshmi Mittal , chairman of the steel major held a 33% personal stake in KazStroyService (KSS), the parent company of KSS Petron, which he sold off before bidding for Essar Steel as promoters of defaulting companies are barred from bidding for other companies. This, however, was not recognised by the Supreme Court and in it's October ruling last year, it asked it to pay dues owed by both Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, amounting to Rs 7,469 crore (including Rs 1,647 crore owed by KSS Petron) to become eligible to bid for Essar.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Institutional investors switch focus to entity-level exposure</h1>", "description": "Mumbai | Bengaluru: Institutional investors, especially private equity (PE) firms, are gradually moving towards entity-level investments from project-level exposure. The PE funds pumped in up to $3.3 billion into the Indian real estate through entity-level investments between 2017 and 2018, showed the data obtained from ANAROCK Property Consultants.  This is three times the amount \u2014 $1.1 billion \u2014 invested by them between 2015 and 2016. The share of PE funds\u2019 entity-level investments into Indian realty rose from 22% in 2015 -16 to over 39% in 2017-18.  \u201cThis is significant given the present cashcrunch in the Indian real estate sector. Longer-term funding can help developers address long-term issues rather\u2026 The increase in entity-level investments implies increasing confidence in developers with high corporate governance scores,\u201d said Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO, ANAROCK Capital.  Over the last couple of years, the Indian real estate has witnessed marquee international institutional investors deploying capital through such entity-level transactions.  Singapore\u2019s GIC invested $1.39 billion in DLF\u2019s rental portfolio, Blackstone invested $730 million in Indiabulls Real Estate , while Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) invested $500 million in Indospace.  While entity-level investments by PE players come at the cost of lower returns and higher due diligence requirements, they are of greater overall value for the real estate market in general and developers and private equity players in particular.  At the peak of real estate cycle in 2007, investors were investing all across \u2014 largely at the project level \u2014 as the picture looked rosy then. However, after the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008 and up to 2014, they turned more selective. They refocused on select developers with good past track records, and with whom they felt comfortable.  Despite this new focus on comfort and credibility, private equity investments remained limited largely to the individual projectlevel.  This approach was very much in evidence in the 2015 to 2018 period, wherein around two-third of private equity investments in Indian real estate were at the project level. Of the total $14.01 billion private equity funds in Indian real estate over the last four years, more than $4.4 billion were infused at the entity level.  A deep dive into data reveals that the focus on portfolio or entity-level investments picked up momentum in the latter half of the period between 2017 and 2018. In this period, entity-level private equity inflows almost tripled compared to the previous two years.  \u201cIndian real estate is now offering improved transparency and confidence to institutional investor in the backdrop of new regulatory approach and policy regime.  Developers are operating in a completely new environment and their approach has also seen a transformation. Macroeconomic indicators have also turned po-sitive on many counts including IMF\u2019s forecast of India\u2019s GDP growth rate,\u201d said CEO of a real estate company that has also recently concluded an entity level deal with a fund.  Thanks to the positive market signals, private equity investors once again reposed their faith in the Indian real estate sector - particularly in commercial real estate. In fact, the new sunshine sectors of logistics & warehousing as well as retail real estate are attracting entity-level private equity investments.  Entity-level investment is an efficient strategy to get a firmer foothold in the real estate market. It allows a private equity investment firm to not only deploy its capital but also gain synergetic skills in the real estate marketplace. Private equity firms invariably look for high levels of corporate governance in a real estate development company before deciding to invest in it at an entity level.  Project-level investments take shorterterm view of capital deployment as they do not necessarily involve partnering with the developer over the long haul. Rather, a PE firm will invest in a developer's project, which involves a lower commitment and is, for that reason, a less risky approach to investing in real estate.  Entity-level investments, on the other hand, involve multiple projects and require the forging long-term business alliances.  They require a thorough due diligence of the entity\u2019s financials, as opposed to project-level investments where the fund will primarily seek to understand the financials of an individual project.

Avanta India, part of UK-based Avanta group, currently has five operational business centres, all in the national capital region (NCR). These five centres are spread over 1.2 lakh sq ft and has 1,200 seating capacity.  \"We have taken on lease 20,000 sq ft office space in Kasturba Ganghi Marg near Connaught Place, Delhi. This will be our sixth centre,\" Avanta India MD Nakul Mathur said.  The new centre will have 280 seats, he said, adding that the company charges anywhere between Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 per seat depending on location.  Mathur said the company would invest Rs 10 crore on setting up of this new centre, to be operational next month, adding that the company was looking at expanding in new cities.  The company as well as all of its five operational centres are profitable, he said.  \"For over a decade, we have been providing top-class flexible office spaces and services in India. We understand that operating out-of-business centres is convenient and cost-effective than just renting an office space, thus we make sure that our clients get every opportunity to thrive,\" he said.  In September 2008, Avanta started operations from Statesman House in Connaught Place as its first business centre in the national capital.  According to a recent report from CBRE, co-working operators have leased 2.9 million sq ft of area, largely office space, during January-March 2019 across seven major cities - a jump of nearly four folds from the year-ago period, to meet rising demand for shared and flexible workplace.

This is the second insolvency proposal for Jaypee Infratech to be put on vote. On May 3, home buyers and lenders rejected Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty\u2019s bid, which was the only proposal left in the fray after creditors had rejected NBCC\u2019s offer citing lack of approvals from government. However, on May 1, NBCC\u2019s revised bid got the government\u2019s approval, a week after lenders of the realty developer had rejected the offer.  Calls and text message to Jaypee Infratech\u2019s Insolvency Resolution Professional Anuj Jain did not elicit any response for the story.  Financial creditors, in a meeting held last week, sought more clarity from NBCC over its revised bid. The queries were related to specific financing of the resolution proposal for the debt-hit Jaypee Infratech. Apart from this, the lenders had also sought clarity on unsold inventory to be picked up them, timing of monetization, price at which this inventory will be transferred to lenders, etc.  According to reports on Monday, NBCC had decided not to dilute any of its conditions in revised offer for Jaypee Infratech. The state-run company has sought waivers from tax and other claims of at least over Rs 40,000 crore on Jaypee Infratech in its revised bid to acquire the real estate company, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  NBCC made these claims under the header -- Reliefs and Concessions -- in its revised bid that it had submitted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) on April 24.  In its revised offer, NBCC had asked for an income tax waiver of Rs 33,000 crore against transfer of land parcels from Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to Jaypee Infratech. It has said in its offer that the Income Tax Authority has been making an addition to the income of about Rs 2,950 crore on an annual basis, which is estimated to be a tax demand of Rs 33,000 crore for a period of 30 years, treating the transfer of land parcels as revenue subsidy. Of this, the department has already raised claims of Rs 3,334 crore.  Meanwhile, the Allahabad bench of NCLT has allowed debt-stressed realty developer\u2019s insolvency resolution process, which was scheduled to come to an end on May 6, to continue until May 21. This had paved way for the CoC to consider NBCC\u2019s revised bid to acquire Jaypee Infratech.

Also, the companies are expecting higher adoption of superior technology and power efficient range of inverter air conditioners (ACs) by consumers, with northern India being seen as a bigger demand driver in the market as usual.  AC makers also hope that slightly higher temperatures this summer, as predicted by the Met department, will push sales in the coming months. Consumers are being lured by companies with several offers that include easy finance, extended warranty and free service etc.  Daikin India MD and CEO Kanwaljeet Jawa looks at this season as \"very promising\" for the residential AC segment and believes that fundamentals are in place and intact.  \"The industry is poised at an inflection penetration of 7-8 per cent, and I see it exploding over 10 per cent. The developed nations like Japan, the US, Australia and China are all above 90 per cent penetration. India has a huge potential. I predict the industry growing at 14-15 per cent during FY2019-20,\" he added.  Besides, companies are expecting higher rural electrification and rise in disposable income and aspiration levels to help ramp up sales figures this year.  They are investing substantially on branding and market to reach consumers in tier III places and rural areas.  \"This year the IMD has predicted strong summers, and some of the green shoots are already visible with temperatures rising in southern India in March itself, and markets showing buoyancy in parts of east and west India,\" Voltas MD and CEO Pradeep Bakshi told .  Panasonic India President and CEO Manish Sharma said there is a progressive shift in the consumer demand for upgraded technologies and energy-efficient range of ACs.  \"The progressive shift in the consumer demand for upgraded technologies, energy-efficiency and health and lifestyle value offerings has had a positive rub-off on the air conditioners segment and driving growth of the industry. This coupled with improvement in consumer's discretionary income and rapid electrification are other factors that would contribute to the growth in the industry,\" said Sharma.  According to him, last year the AC industry saw a slow growth in volume sales while the value sales witnessed marginal increase of around 5 per cent driven by the demand shift towards inverter AC.  Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India CMD Gurmeet Singh said: \"Yes, the air conditioning industry in the last couple of years has seen a weak growth but we expect that trend to turnaround this year. Given the timely onset of summer and the prediction of below normal monsoon this year, we expect that the industry would see a double-digit growth over last year.\"  LG Electronics India VP Home Appliances and Air Conditioners Vijay Babu said that in the January-March quarter, the company has already witnessed around 38 per cent increase in sales (by value) and expect this to be over 40 per cent in the current April-June quarter.  \"Now the farthest corner of the country has been electrified and there would be a definite rise in demand from tier III and IV places this season,\" Babu added.  According to Haier Appliances President Eric Braganza, with changing preferences, AC is no longer a luxury goods and is gradually becoming a necessary appliances.  Haier, which had witnessed a 40 per cent growth in residential AC segment and 50 per cent in commercial AC business in 2018, expects to \"continue with the same momentum\" with locally relevant product portfolio, Braganza added.  Blue Star Managing Director B Thiagarajan said, \"We continue to make significant investment in product development, after sales service, as well as brand building and are confident of enhancing our market share.\"  The Indian room AC industry market is expected to be of around 4.5 million units with more than 20 companies competing in the space.", "published_date": "Apr 07, 2019, 05.33 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:52:54", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/durables/ac-makers-expect-a-double-digit-sales-growth-this-summer/articleshow/68764512.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The agreement means that domestic and commercial washing machines incorporating the company's innovative Xeros technology will be made and sold in India by IFB Industries Ltd from 2020-2021.  It marks the first time that the UK firm's XOrb technology will go to market in a domestic washing machine anywhere in the world, which the company claims will \"change washing machines forever\" by cutting down on water use in commercial machines by up to 80 per cent and domestic machines by up to 50 per cent.  \"This licensing agreement with the leading Indian OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) for both the domestic appliance and commercial laundry markets is another major milestone in the commercialisation of our cleaning technologies,\" said Mark Nichols, Chief Executive of Xeros.  \"IFB's capabilities and market reach make them a very strong commercialisation partner in a country where water demand is expected to increase by more than 60 per cent over the next 30 years with some 80 per cent of the current population already impacted by water scarcity ,\" he said.  Xeros claims the agreement with IFB will help consumers reduce water, detergent and energy consumption, with simultaneous improved cleaning performance and garment life extension.  The Development and Licensing Agreement clinched this week has a 10-year duration and covers the incorporation and commercialisation of Xeros' water saving XOrb\u2122 and XDrum\u2122 technologies into selected ranges of IFB's domestic and commercial sized washing machines.  Xeros said it will immediately receive a one-off exclusivity fee and during the development phase further payments when various milestones are reached. IFB will have access to Xeros' technology and has been granted rights to the Indian market on an exclusive basis and for other South Asian territories on a non-exclusive basis. The contract has the provision to add additional territories on a non-exclusive basis.  Xeros will also receive royalties based on sales revenues after the machines have completed development. Sales of commercial washing machines and domestic washing machines incorporating Xeros' technologies are planned to commence in India in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  IFB, listed on the National Stock Exchange of India, claims to be a leading domestic appliance and commercial laundry equipment supplier in South Asia. Its sales last year rose by 20 per cent to more than 400,000 (front-loading) washing machines, with the overall Indian market for washing machine sales growing rapidly among the country's urbanised and affluent population.  Xeros, a platform technology company that works on reinventing water intensive industrial and commercial processes, believes the reason the Indian market is important for its water-saving technology is that the country is under extreme water stress.

As part of this, the Godrej group company is get into premium kitchen appliances, large capacity refrigerators and front-loading washing machines while premiumising its air-conditioners and microwave ovens, said business head Kamal Nandi.  It is commissioning a new Rs 200 crore plant in Pune to manufacture the premium range, as Nandi said Godrej will be the first company to domestically manufacture large capacity appliances which are all currently imported.  \u201cThe premium product market may be small, but it is growing at a high pace for the past 3-5 years. It will be difficult to be amongst the top three brands in India without a presence in the premium segment which also helps to build the brand imagery,\u201d said Nandi.  Godrej Appliances had clocked a revenue of Rs 3,300 crore in the fiscal ending March 2017 which it wants to grow to more than Rs 6,000 crore by 2020 with half of the revenue generated from premium products. The company will next year launch refrigerators with multiple doors in 500-litre plus capacity and front-loading washing machines for which it has entered into a product development partnership with an overseas company.  Nandi said the company is premiumising even mass segment products such as using steel drums in semi-automatic washing machines which are used mostly in front-loading. \u201cWe had a minimal presence in retail chains which will be beefed up since most of the premium products are sold through them. While retail chains account for 12% of total industry sales, its just 4% for us,\u201d he said.  Godrej is the fourth largest player in refrigerators after LG, Samsung and Whirlpool with 14% share. It has 10% share in washing machines but is the second largest in semi-automatic washing machine after LG with 15% share; it has 5% share in air-conditioners and 4% in microwave ovens.  While Videocon is the largest homegrown consumer electronics maker, Godrej Appliances finds a scope to take the pole position considering Videocon is currently in sticky wicket due to debt crisis whereby there is a supply crunch of products.", "published_date": "Nov 30, 2017, 07.29 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:52:57", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/durables/godrej-appliances-is-venturing-into-premium-products/articleshow/61867200.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

In a meeting on Monday, the lenders discussed the bids received from state-run construction company NBCC and Suraksha Asset Reconstruction Company. Both bidders made separate presentations to the CoC.  \u201cLenders are likely to negotiate with both the bidders separately and these meetings will be held over the next two to three weeks. Jaypee Group promoter Manoj Gaur was also present in today\u2019s meeting,\u201d said one of the persons mentioned above.  Anuj Jain, the insolvency resolution professional (IRP), had shortlisted four players \u2014 NBCC, Kotak Investment, Singapore-based Cube Highways and the Suraksha Group \u2014 and asked them to submit their resolution plans by February 15.  According to the persons mentioned above, as part of its proposal, NBCC has offered to hive off Taj Expressway and give it to lenders. The value of the road project is over Rs 6,000 crore given the toll collection. NBCC has asked lenders to provide Rs 2,000 crore in lieu of this project. Half of this will be returned to lenders as part of repayment package and balance will be used for completion of projects, estimated to cost Rs 1,500 crore. NBCC has also offered to give 1,400 acres as debt-asset swap and is looking to build homes in these stuck projects in four years.  \u201cCoC had called for the presentations from the bidders and we made our presentation today. Although I cannot share details of our commercial proposal because of confidentiality, but I can certainly say that we are confident of delivering the flats ahead of the times frame we have proposed,\u201d Anoop Kumar Mittal , CMD, NBCC, told ET.  Suraksha ARC, as part of its bid, offered debt asset swap to lenders in addition to an upfront payment of around Rs 20 crore.

The NBCC's revised bid to acquire Jaypee Infratech and complete the work of over 20,000 flats would be discussed on May 14 by the Committee of Creditors (CoC), they added.  On Friday, lenders wrote to the NBCC seeking clarifications on certain relief and concessions put forward by the public sector firm in its resolution plan.  According to sources, NBCC has decided not to dilute the conditions of exemption from income tax liability as well as from taking consent of development authorities for transfer of businesses. It has also not agreed to change its proposal that lenders should take unsold flats in case state-owned firm fails to sell them in the market.  To make changes in these clauses, sources said, NBCC needed approvals from its board as well as government departments.  Without these changes, it remains to be seen whether the CoC decide to put NBCC's bid for voting by bankers and home buyers or reject it without voting.  Homebuyers are likely to vote in favour of NBCC bid but many flat owners fear that lenders may reject it and opt for liquidation as they do no want a hair-cut of about 60 per cent against its claim of Rs 9,782 crore.  Clarifications from the NBCC were sought in the backdrop of Jaypee Infratech's Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Anuj Jain flagging to the lenders that NBCC's bid was conditional and non-binding.  Jain had written to the CoC that NBCC's revised bid was conditional as the state-owned firm has stated that the plan would not be binding on it unless key relief measures such as extinguishing of income tax liability and a dispensation from seeking consent of YEIDA ( Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) for any business transfer is granted, sources had said.  The CoC is considering NBCC's offer after it rejected Mumbai-based Suraksha Realty's bid on May 3 through voting process under the insolvency law. Earlier, the creditors' panel did not allow vote on NBCC's bid citing lack of approvals from the government departments. NBCC has now got all the necessary approvals.  In its revised offer, NBCC has proposed infusion of Rs 200 crore equity capital, transfer of 950 acres of land worth Rs 5,000 crore to banks and completing construction of flats by July 2023 to settle an outstanding claim of Rs 23,723 crore of financial creditors.  The court-mandated deadline for completing the resolution plan for Japyee Infratech ended on May 6 and the CoC has sought an extension of the deadline.  The Allahabad bench of NCLT has posted the matter for hearing on May 21 and maintained status quo till then.  Apart from NBCC, Adani Group has also shown interest to bid for Jaypee Infratech but creditors have not sought resolution plan from Adani so far.  Interestingly, Jaypee Group 's promoters too have put in a bid, under Section 12A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, to retain control of the company.  In 2017, Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency after NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of the firm.  During the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha Group, was rejected by lenders.  In October 2018, the IRP started a fresh initiative to revive Jaypee Infratech on the NCLT direction.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), the promoter of Jaypee Infratech, had submitted Rs 750 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court for the refund to buyers and the amount is lying with NCLT.", "published_date": "May 13, 2019, 09.51 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:53:04", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/nbcc-decides-not-to-dilute-conditions-in-revised-offer-for-jaypee-infratech/articleshow/69312978.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">IPL buzz pulling female viewers away from TV serials</h1>", "description": "Mumbai: With more and more matches of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) ending in nail-biting finishes, the excitement, hype and the adrenalin rush, along with the fact that India continuous to be a single TV household, is making female audiences to let go of their favourite daily soaps on general entertainment channels (GECs), and switch to IPL .  As per BARC viewership data sourced from a subscriber, during the first three weeks of the IPL, Hindi GECs \u2013 Star Plus, Colors, Sony Entertainment Television, Zee TV, &TV, Star Bharat and Sony Sab \u2013 collectively lost almost 10% female (15+ years) viewership in the Hindi speaking markets (HSM) during primetime hours of 7 pm \u2013 midnight.  In terms of average impressions in the three weeks (March 23- April 12) Colors and &TV lost maximum \u2014 22% and 15% \u2014 of their female audience, respectively, while Zee TV and Sony Entertainment registered a drop of around 8% each.  It is important to note that GECs attract mass audiences and command over Rs 11,000-13,000 crore in advertising dollars, which is almost 35% of the overall advertising spend on television.  \u201cDuring IPL historically we have seen viewership of other genres go down. GECs are more skewed towards female audiences; it is not unusual to see a drop in female viewership considering that India is still a single TV household,\u201d said Navin Khemkha, CEO at Mediacom South Asia.  Khemkha added that the performance of IPL is also a big factor. \u201cGiven that this time more teams are performing better and the matches are more competitive, the interest in the tournament is also more than previous year.\u201d  Overall timespent per (female) viewer also dropped to 264 minutes, from an average of 289 minutes, registering a 8.8% drop, while overall market share of the seven channels in the HSM, saw a 9.6% drop \u2013 from 29.8% to 26.9%.  However, the data also suggests that a major chunk of this female audience came back to catch up on daily soaps during the repeat telecast, which resulted in almost zero impact on the overall weekly reach of the channels.  A senior executive of a GEC said that IPL is a 50-day phenomenon, but daily soaps are a habit. \u201cWith more than 90% of the Indian TV households having only one TV, it is quite possible for the women to cede control of the remote in the primetime, but they won\u2019t let go of their shows. They come back to watch either on TV while repeat telecast, or on the OTT players,\u201d he summed up.  Earlier this week, ET reported that the average viewership number of women watching IPL has increased almost 18% in the first three weeks to 10.3 million impressions, which has also triggered a rush among brands focusing on women, such as Lotus Herbals, Fena Detergent, Senco Gold & Diamonds, Usha International, Rasna, Fashion Big Bazaar and FabIndia, for sponsorship or advertising either on television or with teams.

It released in Hindi, English, Tamil and Telugu across 2,845 screens in India on Friday.  The Marvel Studios ' film has taken the Indian box office by storm. According to the film's representatives, the movie collected Rs 61.19 crore (gross box office collection) and Rs 51.40 crore (net box office collection) on day two. Total for two days stands at Rs 124.40 crore gross box office collection (Rs 104.50 crore net box).  Trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted on Sunday: \"'Avengers: Endgame' is rewriting record books. Puts up a historic total on Day 2. Eyes Rs 150 crore + weekend. No biggie from Hindi film industry has achieved the target so far.\"  Comparing it to filmmaker S.S. Rajamouli's magnum opus \"Baahubali 2\", Adarsh wrote: \"'Baahubali 2' (Hindi) rewrote the rules of the game exactly two years ago. Almost everyone felt that the records attained by the film will remain unchallenged for a long, long time. But 'Avengers: Endgame' is challenging it right now.\"  \"'Avengers: Endgame' shatters the myth that a massive screen count is the key to collect big numbers on Day 1/weekend.

Those who have come on board include PhonePe and Havells (co-presenting sponsors); Byju\u2019s, MRF, policybazaar.com, paisabazaar.com, Amazon, Royal Stag, and Dream11 (associate sponsors); and Uber, Pernod Ricard , Mondelez, Acko General Insurance and Ceat Tyres, among others, across TV and digital platforms.  Sources in Star India told ET that the company is hopeful of selling 90% of the overall inventory by mid of this month and rest of it will be kept for last minute spot buyers.  \u201cThe momentum into World Cup is very positive and the market feedback is very good. One month in advance, we have 35 clients. This is going to be our biggest World Cup,\u201d said a senior Star India executive, who did not wish to be named.  Star India will launch its marketing campaign for the World Cup on May 5, during the ongoing Indian Premier League , to build excitement. The broadcaster is also planning to launch Marathi sports channel ahead of the World Cup.  Some media experts feel that it is the power of cricket, which has helped Star India sell inventory much in advance in a difficult year. They feel the broadcaster will be able to earn about Rs 1,000 crore in ad revenues from the tournament. Also, the fact that the tournament will have 50% more India matches, compared with the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, has helped generate greater interest.  Moreover, most of the matches will be in the primetime, thanks to the time difference with the host country England.  Anand Chakravarthy, managing director at Essence India, a GroupM company, feels that the interest level among advertisers for the World Cup is high and there\u2019s no question whether it is a great property for brands looking to create some impact.  \u201cIt\u2019s a high impact property, which should be used by the brands for not just short term gains but build long term equity,\u201d Chakravarthy said. \u201cWorld Cup, a once in four year event, is the holy grail of cricket, and therefore one of the most mass entertainment opportunities in India. Cricket cuts across and is completely geo-agnostic.\u201d  Scheduled to be played from May 30 to July 14, the World Cup will be hosted in England this year. The one-and-a-half month tournament will see 10 nations playing for the most coveted trophy in the world of cricket.  Also, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has changed the format of the World Cup to round robin after a gap of 27 years. And with round robin format, all the teams will be playing at least one match with each other, which will make India play a minimum of nine games, with a high probability of making it to the semifinals.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Video OTT market in India to be among global top 10 by 2020; touch $823 mn: Study</h1>", "description": "Video OTT market in India - which primarily comprises content streaming services - is likely to be ranked among the top 10 markets globally with a market size of USD 823 million (about Rs 5,363 crore) by 2022, a ASSOCHAM-PwC joint study said Thursday.  \"The Indian video OTT market is at a fairly nascent stage, the video OTT market globally has entered into the growth phase of the market life cycle. With a CAGR of 22.6 per cent during the period of 2017\u20132022, the Indian video OTT market is poised to outperform the global video OTT market, which is pegged to have a CAGR of 10.1 per cent during the same period,\" it said.  The study titled 'Video on Demand: Entertainment reimagined' further noted that by 2022, the Indian video OTT market will be amongst the top 10 markets globally with a market size of USD 823 million (Rs 5,363 crore).  Video OTT (over the top) services in India include the likes of Netflix , Amazon Prime Video, YouTube etc.  \"The five fundamental drivers of this convergent business model are uninterrupted connectivity, mobile devices becoming the primary source of content consumption, the need to move away from traditional revenue streams, value shifting from content creators to platforms, and ability to provide a personalised offering to the consumer,\" the report said.  During the same time, the number of smartphone users in the country is expected to touch 859 million by 2022 from 468 million users in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12.9 per cent.  With lower-than-ever data tariffs and increasing smartphone penetration in the country, it is safe to assume that the video on demand (VoD) market will be a significant beneficiary of these developments, the study said.  \"Internet consumption is clearly on the rise in India. The important factor for the VoD industry is the availability of devices that are compatible with online video viewing. A large volume of consumption occurs on smartphones,\" it added.  Apart from smartphones, tablets are another promising device for the VoD industry.  \"However, India has just about 5.3 per cent penetration as of 2017, and this is expected to go up to just about 10 per cent in 2022. The low penetration is definitely a missed opportunity for players as tablets offer fairly larger screens which are better for consuming HD content as compared to smartphones,\" the study said.  The study further pointed out that television is the largest sub-segment within the entertainment and media industry, and will continue to remain so in the near future.  While the Indian television industry is set to grow from USD 13.3 billion in 2017 to USD 22 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 10.6 per cent, the global growth average is as low as 1.4 per cent, it said.  \"This proves that India will continue to ride on traditional forms of entertainment despite the disruption in the industry. Television is one of the most economical forms of content consumption, making it a popular source of entertainment for rural India,\" noted the joint study.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">SC seeks Centre's reply on plea to regulate Netflix, Amazon Prime Video content</h1>", "description": "BENGALURU: The Supreme Court has sought the Centre\u2019s views on a petition that calls for regulation of content on video streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, renewing a debate on censorship and freedom of expression.  The petition seeks the formulation of guidelines or legislation to regulate content to block what it describes as sexually explicit, vulgar and violent content. The special leave petition was filed by an NGO called Justice for Rights Foundation (JRF) against a decision of the Delhi High Court , which had dismissed its public interest litigation calling for censorship in February. The NGO was represented by advocate Harpreet Singh Hora.  \u201cThe said online platforms are displaying unlicensed, unregulated, uncertified content and collecting subscription amounts from Indian consumers whereas the content telecasted on the online platforms is illegal,\u201d the petition stated.  ET has reviewed a copy of the petition.     The absence of guidelines has given rise to a special class of broadcasters and this discriminates against customers, cable TV producers and direct-to-home operators, it said.  \u201cThese platforms are running (in) a legal vacuum in an illegal way. My point, is who is responsible if these platforms\u2019 content causes riots or shows something against India,\u201d said JRF founder Satyam Singh Rajput.  \u201cThere should be a watchdog for these platforms. The self-regulatory code is a sham, a pretence.\u201d Commenting on the SC move, Karan Bedi, CEO of MX Player, said: \u201cThese developments are at a very preliminary stage and there is no clarity on the extent or manner in which the government proposes to regulate OTT (over the top) streaming platforms.\u201d  MX Player is owned by Times Internet, the digital arm of the Times Group \u2014 the publisher of The Economic Times. Netflix and ALTBalaji declined to comment. Hotstar , Amazon Prime and Jio didn\u2019t respond to queries.  In January, online platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, Jio and ALTBalaji and Eros Now signed a voluntary censorship code that stops them from showing certain kinds of content. They also set up a redressal mechanism for complaints. The petitioner has asked the court whether online platforms can be restricted from operating till they get a valid licence from a competent authority and until regulations or legislation are in place.  The Delhi HC had dismissed the plea after it was informed by the central government that the online platforms were neither required to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, nor was their content regulated by it. The Ministry of Law and Justice had also stated that the matter was outside its domain.  The high court had observed that since the law did not require such platforms to acquire a licence, it cannot direct them to get one. The court had suggested the petitioner explore the first information report route. A similar plea is pending before the Karnataka High Court where another petitioner has sought regulation of content on online streaming services including Netflix, Hotstar, and Amazon Prime Video. The court issued notices in the matter earlier this year.

The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India has teamed up with M\u00e9diam\u00e9trie (France), Numeris (Canada) and Video Research (Japan) to form the Global Alliance for the Measurement of Media Audiences (GAMMA), which will work on audience measurement initiatives including the development of common technical standards and operational processes.  The four founding nations together account for a population of more than 1.5 billion and advertising spend of $78 billion, about 15% of the worldwide total.  \u201cAudience measurement across the world needs to constantly innovate to keep pace with emerging trends,\u201d said BARC India CEO Partho Dasgupta. \u201cWe at BARC India have always been open to learning from our global counterparts, and this international alliance offers a tremendous platform to not only learn from our peers but also contribute.\u201d  GAMMA has appointed Brad Bedford, a veteran audience measurement executive, as its global managing director.  \u201cThere is an ever-increasing demand for cross device measurement internationally and the partnering of these audience measurement firms seeks to facilitate continued movement in that direction,\u201d said Bedford. \u201cI am honoured to represent this effort on a global scale. We are confident GAMMA will be a source of great knowledge sharing and continued learning for the industry.\u201d  The need for a global alliance was felt owing to rapid advancements in technology that are re-shaping both distribution and consumption of content. These changes have a global impact given the nature of digital media.  GAMMA aims to leverage the collective knowledge and sector expertise of each member to advance audience measurement solutions worldwide. Through close cooperation, the participants intend to identify strategies and solutions that are more transparent and standardised.

It is now actively looking at partnerships with various stakeholders including content players, telecom operators and TV makers to give a push uptake of Fire TV stick in the country, having sold over a million Fire TV Stick devices in India since April 2017.  \u201cWe are looking at those partnerships. We do have eyes on the market and some of the partnerships are in the pipeline,\u201d Parag Gupta, Head \u2013 Product & Marketing, Amazon India told ET.  The Amazon Fire TV Stick is a content streaming device that plugs into an HDTV and lets customers access Prime Video and other over-the-top content services like Netflix, Hotstar .  \u201cWe also have content partnerships with various content players. Basis the partnerships, we are able to various on-demand services to the Fire TV stick. That is the channel that has opened up for us. There are always conversations,\u201d he said.  The company\u2019s focus is to build content selection for device users, hence it is agnostic to services like Prime Video, Netflix or Hotstar. \u201cSome of these relationships, the way industry and the channel move will evolve. Our focus is to deliver better experience and selection.\u201d  Gupta said that the trend of original content has picked up in India with major OTT players making a significant investment to build the content library.  \u201cAll this is good because it increased the selection that people want to watch. That is a very key part of enabling technology like Fire TV to bring that content to bigger screens,\u201d he said.  The improving connectivity infrastructure is also helping in the growth of the device as more people are cutting the cord and switching to streaming services, the executive said.  \u201cOn a weekly, consumption of content on the stick is close to 1000 years which roughly translates to a couple of hours a day. A lot of content is being watched and people are cutting the cord,\u201d he said.  Amazon had previously inked several bundling partnerships with telcos like Bharti Airtel and broadband players like ACT Fibernet and Spectra.  Amazon this week joined hands with direct-to-home service operator Tata Sky to launch a new service called Tata Sky Binge. The service will be accessible through the purchase of Amazon Fire TV Stick \u2013 Tata Sky Edition, to allow users to view content from apps like Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Sun NXT, Eros NOW, and Hungama Play.  Amazon\u2019s Fire TV stick is the leading device in the market with a commanding market share, Amazon claimed citing IDC research.  Amazon has claimed that the uptake of the device has increased in the country after the launch of the 4K variant. \u201cWe have locked in new customers and expanded the overall pie. The 4K stick it is one of the bestselling devices and we expect the trend to continue this year,\u201d he said.  The executive said that the availability of 4K content will help in increasing the uptake of its 4K device going forward. \u201cAs a Prime video, we have made a commitment to it that all our original content will be 4K including Indian originals. We are hoping that the rest of the industry takes the same direction,\u201d he said.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">TV9\u2019s minority shareholders move NCLT</h1>", "description": "Minority shareholders, led by former TV9 chief executive officer Ravi Prakash , have moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging that the company\u2019s majority shareholders had violated its restraining orders.  The minority shareholders, who together claim to hold a 9.43% stake in TV9, sought to set aside the sale of the company and block the appointment of four nominees of the new majority owners to the board, claiming such acts violated the tribunal\u2019s orders. Alleging oppression and mismanagement, the minority shareholders, including directors MKVN Murthy and Clifford Pereira, urged the tribunal to stop the director-nominees of the majority shareholders from conducting board and shareholder meetings and from infusing fresh capital. The tribunal had passed an order on September 4 restraining Associated Broadcasting Company, the operator of the TV9 bouquet of channels, from selling shares or assets while responding to a petition by a fund of SAIF Partners.  SAIF III Mauritius Company had moved NCLT to prevent the sale of TV9 by its majority stakeholder and venture capitalist Srini Raju and his associates. It claimed that the funds it had invested 10 years ago in IVision Media, a firm controlled by Srini Raju, were given to ABCL as intercorporate deposits to help siphon off the money.  The Mauritius fund claimed that it had invested \u20b950.37 crore for an 80% stake in IVision Media in August 2008 after an assurance that IVision Media would be merged into ABCL, giving it 14.29% stake in the combined entity. Neither did the merger take place nor was SAIF provided an exit route.  Last month, SAIF moved the tribunal with a contempt case against Raju and associates, accusing them of selling TV9 in violation of restraining orders. Raju said the tribunal\u2019s orders not to alienate shares and assets were directed at ABCL and not its shareholders.  Two Hyderabad-based infrastructure groups acquired 82% stake in the company from Raju and associates for about \u20b9460 crore and have nominated four of their representatives to the board.  The minority shareholders alleged they were being coerced to sell their stakes in favour of Alanda Media & Entertainments, the holding company of infrastructure groups, which now claims to hold a 90.54% stake.  The minority shareholders led by Prakash also moved the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, alleging violations by the new shareholders, apart from oppression, mismanagement and wrongful and illegal intimidation tactics.  \u201cThere is no violation of restraining orders of the tribunal since Alanda Media signed the share purchase agreement on August 24 last year, much before the restraining orders were passed,\u201d Srinivasa Rao Aravapalli, a spokesperson of Alanda Media and its nominee director on the ABCL board, told ET .  The minority shareholders claimed they were \u201ccoerced and pressured\u201d by Raju and associates and Alanda Media into passing board resolutions approving the transfer of majority stake in favour of Alanda Media.  Raju and associates recently offered a compromise to SAIF by agreeing to pay \u20b965 crore.  The Mauritius fund informed the tribunal about its willingness to withdraw the contempt petition. Raju said the deal involves buying the entire stake of SAIF in IVision Media and providing SAIF an exit for about \u20b965 crore.  The tribunal, which heard the case on Monday, has reserved its judgement and posted the case for May 23.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">In the age of Netflix, can Doordarshan leverage nostalgia?</h1>", "description": "Sagar Gholap, 42, has been watching Rangoli, Doordarshan\u2019s hour-long programme on Hindi film songs, ever since he was 12. It has been a constant on a weekend morning, a throwback to his childhood when Sunday was the only day he didn\u2019t have to get out of bed at 6 am sharp. \u201cI was allowed to watch Rangoli till 9 am and then start the day. Everyone in my family watched it,\u201d says the Mumbaibased radio professional.  After all these years, every Sunday, Ghalop still gets a call from his mother, who lives in Thane, just as Rangoli gets over. \u201cShe will either discuss how good the songs and the theme of the day were or pan some of the new songs,\u201d he says.  For Gen X, born between the 1960s and \u201980s, DD\u2019s iconic shows like Rangoli are a way to connect to their past. If the middle-aged is nostalgic, there are millennials who are curious. In some ways, it is borrowed nostalgia .  Nostalgia is perhaps Doordarshan\u2019s biggest USP. It lets millennials, from rural and urban India, find value in DD shows even when they have a plethora of options in satellite channels, OTT platforms and the internet.    Take Rohit Rajan, 28. The Mumbaibased promo-producer for a TV channel has watched movies on DD\u2019s Sunday afternoon slot for years now, even when his hectic job leaves him no time for TV on most days. \u201cUntil last year, I\u2019d watch movies on DD Odia and DD Bangla as well, thanks to subtitles. The kind of regional movies that you find on DD are hard to find on Netflix ,\u201d says Rajan. Ek Cup Chya, a Marathi movie that he had seen on DD many moons ago, has recently come on Netflix. Rajan isn\u2019t the only one going retro in a metro. There are others in the same age group reverting to viewing DD. They may be an exception but their sustained interest in DD shows the broadcaster\u2019s attempts at fighting the popular perception of its irrelevance are working.  Sumex Singla, a 32-year-old entrepreneur from Haryana\u2019s Kurukshetra district, spends over an hour on OTT platforms every day. \u201cBut I watch half an hour of DD News every night. It gives me a lowdown of everything that\u2019s happening in the country and informs me about government schemes. I find a lot of value in that than in listening to people shouting in panel discussions,\u201d he says.  Dharamveer Kamboj, a farmer from Yamunanagar\u2019s Damla village, watches DD Kisan \u2014 a channel for farmers \u2014 whenever he gets a chance. So does his 27-year-old son. Every progressive farmer watches it, he says. \u201cI was in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, for an event recently and they said they saw me on a DD Kisan show the previous day.\u201d Kamboj hopes DD Kisan will soon be available on his mobile phone.  Down in Chennai, 32-year-old Rupa Harilakshminarsimhan religiously watches Chitrahaar, a half-hour music show. \u201cYou get a good mix of old and new songs,\u201d she says. She also uses apps to consume music. \u201cBut these shows have a personal touch. They make you feel like your elder sister is speaking to you while taking you through a journey full of songs.\u201d She has picked this viewing habit from her father, P Ranganathan, a retired mechanical engineer from Tata Steel, Jamshedpur, who has been an avid viewer of the show since its inception in 1984.  However, a generation is far removed from DD: the Gen Z, born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s.  Banaras-born and Delhi-based Shiza Khan, 19, says Doordarshan means nothing to her. \u201cIt makes me think of something dull and boring, and black & white, of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI have heard about some shows like Shaktimaan from my older siblings. But I\u2019ve never tuned into DD, not even by mistake.\u201d Mumbai\u2019s Ghalop stands in stark contrast. The only channel number he remembers on his DTH service provider is that of DD National: 114.  Even Ranganathan\u2019s younger daughter, in her late 20s, laughs at him for watching Chitrahaar while she Netflix-es. \u201cMost youngsters are not interested in DD. Their day begins with WhatsApp, goes on with Facebook and Twitter, and ends with YouTube.\u201d  Supriya Sahu, director-general of Doordarshan, is cognisant of the network\u2019s limitations. \u201cWe have an ageing workforce and legacy issues in terms of how content is developed. We have tried to change our approach to production to improve the look and feel of the channels,\u201d she says.  Rangoli now has a millennial anchor in actor Surveen Chawla. \u201cWhen I was offered to anchor the show, I thought I could make it appeal to a younger generation,\u201d she says. \u201cMy inputs to make the script colloquial have been well-received.\u201d Rangoli is the No. 1 show in its time band, says Sahu. The show is aired every Sunday from 8 am to 9 am.  DD also has a social media outreach team at each of its 66 kendras (offices) that run several accounts across Twitter, Facebook, You-Tube, and Instagram. \u201cIn 2012, people were surprised that DD had a Twitter handle. Now we run more than 35 Twitter accounts. The main account has over 269,000 followers,\u201d says Arjun Mehto, senior content manager at Doordarshan. The network makes Rs 6-7 lakh in monthly revenue off its YouTube channels, Mehto adds.     Where\u2019s the Ad?  Social media engagement, however, is insignificant from a revenue standpoint for the broadcaster. DD\u2019s revenue comes from government ads, DTH revenue (an annual fee of approximately Rs 6-8 crore that each channel pays to be on DD\u2019s Free Dish distributed in several million households) and corporate ads. \u201cDD channels have been the preferred vehicles for FMCG brands to target rural audiences,\u201d says Sahu.  Media agencies, however, note that DD is not as significant for FMCGs anymore. As per the latest Broadcast India Survey released by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), 68% of the country has access to TV and almost 97% of TV households have cable and satellite connections. That leaves 3% with just DD channels. \u201cIn the rest of the 97% households, DD competes with hundreds of cable channels. And the teledensity of the country is 89%. The game has become very competitive. DD has to compete with cable channels and people with smartphones,\u201d says Rajiv Dubey, GM, media, Dabur.  DD\u2019s importance has significantly reduced in Dabur\u2019s media plan in the last five years.  Most FMCG brands weren\u2019t even keen to discuss DD when approached by ET Magazine.  For companies like Parle, though, it still holds importance. \u201cA brand like Parle-G, for instance, has phenomenal reach. It also caters to the 3-5% households that only have a terrestrial network. In five years, you may have 100% DTH penetration. Till then, DD is important for us as a media vehicle,\u201d says Mayank Shah, category head, Parle.  Parle is an anomaly. As Amin Lakhani of media agency Mindshare India says: \u201cAdvertisers will put money on the channel getting maximum viewership from their target audience, rural or urban.\u201d As per BARC India\u2019s viewership data in the week of January 26-February 1, 2019, none of DD\u2019s 16 regional and 7 national channels figured in the top five in major viewership categories like Hindi GEC (General Entertainment Channel), Hindi GEC Rural, Hindi News and Hindi News Rural.    DD\u2019s ratings go up whenever it shows cricket or events like the Republic Day parade. For instance, DD India was the No. 1 channel in the English News category for the week of January 26-February 1, 2019, as per BARC India.    \u201cThe ratings are not as high in general for its regular shows, though,\u201d says Lakhani, president of client leadership at the media agency. \u201cUltimately, people follow content and not a channel\u2019s logo.\u201d  Doordarshan\u2019s net revenue, down to Rs 505.11 crore in 2017 from Rs 516.30 crore in 2016, went up by 4% in 2018 \u2014 Rs 525.49 crore. That\u2019s still less than 1% of the over Rs 70,000 crore Indian TV industry, as per EY 2018 estimates. Meanwhile, the nascent OTT market in India stands at Rs 3,500 crore, according to a BCG report.  Undeterred, Sahu is focused on turning things around. \u201cDD has posted operating profits for the last two financial years, she says. \u201cWe hope to continue this trend to help us invest more funds in content generation.\u201d  There is speculation that conversations are on between DD and OTT platforms for an exchange of content. DD has, meanwhile, announced it will launch its own OTT platform, which will likely have some of its iconic shows. Divya Radhakrishnan, MD of Helios Media, is excited about this possibility. \u201cLook at all the channels that are doing well in rural India like Dangal, Zee Anmol, Star Utsav, and Sony Pal. They are all showing reruns of old successful shows.\u201d She hopes her favourite DD series of the \u201980s, Tamas, will be revived for this platform as well.  As a public broadcaster, DD has the power to tell stories that no other network will, says Paritosh Joshi, a veteran media advisor. Bureaucracy coming in the way of this ambition can be a lethal stumbling block, he adds.  Joshi, too, belongs to a generation high on DD nostalgia. \u201cI started watching TV in my landlord\u2019s home in Delhi\u2019s Karol Bagh back in 1971. As soon as DD\u2019s signature tune began and the yin-and-yang logo started spinning, he would shout out to me and my sister: Chaalu ho gaya, jab marzi aa jao (It has started, you can come when you please). I was 9, my sister 7, when we started taking in the magic of Doordarshan.\u201d He hopes this nostalgia doesn\u2019t die down with their generation.

Travel operators have said that cricket has always been a powerful driver for the travel business and the UK is reporting an over 35% increase in demand for bookings between May 30 and July 14, the duration for the Cup, which happens every 4 years.  Operators said the demand is led by the corporate MICE segment with industries ranging from BFSI to paints looking to travel for the World Cup besides ad hoc groups of friends and young working millennials with the India-Pakistan match on June 16 almost a \u2018mandatory inclusion\u2019 in every tour package.  \u201cThe World Cup is resulting in significant demand not just for the UK, but Ireland too,\u201d said Rajeev Kale, president and country head, holiday, MICE, visa services at Thomas Cook India .   \u201cCustomers are opting for various combinations beyond the traditional favourites like London . Locales like the Lake District, Manchester, Windermere, Liverpool, Windsor, Cambridge, York, are rapidly emerging on the Indian traveller\u2019s radar,\" said Kale.  Portals said that British Airways is moving in fast to fill in the gap created by the collapse of Jet Airways , and from June 2, the UK airline will add four additional services per week to and from Mumbai. British Airways said it was increasing its capacity on the Heathrow to Mumbai service in response to the \u2018increased customer demand\u2019.  \u201cDuring the last Cricket World Cup that was held in Australia-New Zealand in 2015, over 25,000 Indians travelled from across the world to watch the matches. We expect this number to go up significantly considering that our team is playing very well and is expected to go the distance. The demand for the World Cup is quite high and we expect that growth from India to the UK to exceed 30% during the period,\u201d said Karan Anand, head of relationships at Cox & Kings.  England has experienced renewed interest from Indian travellers this year because of the cricket World Cup, said Daniel D\u2019Souza, president and country head, leisure at SOTC Travel.  \u201cMost of our customers who are looking to visit the country are planning their trips and itineraries accordingly so as to witness the four India matches scheduled between June 5 and June 16,\u201d he said.  The British High Commissioner had said last month that over 80,000 Indians are expected to travel to the UK for the Cup.  Kale said venues that are seeing a demand include India-South Africa at South Hampton, India- England in Birmingham, India-Australia at the Oval, London and India \u2013 Sri Lanka in Leeds.  \u201cIn recent years, we have seen a growing trend of travellers combining an international trip with the opportunity to witness major sports events. According to ICC research, India constitutes 90% of the one billion cricket fans. With such a large cricket fan base, we think World Cup would be a major attraction for travel to England this June,\u201d said Balu Ramachandran, head of air and distribution, Cleartrip, a travel portal.

On Monday, Raju and associates filed a compromise petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), agreeing to pay around Rs 65 crore to the fund of SAIF Partners. In return, the fund agreed to withdraw a contempt petition against Raju and associates within 10 days of receiving the payment.  \u201cWe have signed a settlement agreement with SAIF and filed it before the tribunal,\u201d Srini Raju told ET.

After a complaint from SAIF Partners, the Tribunal had on September 4 last year passed an order restraining Associated Broadcasting Company ( ABCL ), the operator of the TV9 bouquet of satellite television channels, from selling its shares or assets until further directive from the bankruptcy court.  While a senior official at ABCL refused to comment on the allegations of SAIF Partners as the matter is pending before a court, Raju denied any wrongdoing or violation of interim orders, claiming that he had completed the stake sale before the bankruptcy court passed the interim orders.  SAIF Partners wanted to block the deal wherein Raju and his associates, who had then controlled ABCL with an 82% stake, agreed to sell their entire holding in favour of a consortium of two Hyderabad based infrastructure groups for around Rs 460 crore.  SAIF III Mauritius Company claimed that the funds it invested 10 years ago in IVision Media, another firm controlled by Srini Raju, were given to ABCL as interest-free loans without its consent and as part of a ploy to siphon off the money. IVision Media was to take up a collection of news content for distribution to print media, TV and radio channels, Internet portals and others.  Having invested Rs 50.37 crore for an 80% stake in IVision Media in August 2008, SAIF claimed it was assured that IVision Media would be merged with ABCL and that it would get a 14.29% stake in the merged entity.

The NCLAT was responding to a petition filed by Alanda Media & Entertainments, the holding company of two Hyderabad-based infrastructure firms that now claims to own 90.54% in Associated Broadcasting Company (ABCL), the operator of TV9 bouquet of channels.  The appellate tribunal, comprising chairperson Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, judicial member Justice AIS Cheema and technical member Kanthi Narahari, directed the NCLT Hyderabad to allow a fund of SAIF Partners to withdraw its contempt petition against the ABCL promoters.  The apex tribunal has posted the case for July 9.  Last week, the minority shareholders moved the tribunal alleging a violation of its restraining orders by the majority shareholders led by Alanda Media, while seeking to set aside the sale of ABCL in favour of the holding company of infrastructure firms.  The minority shareholders sought to block the appointment of four nominees of the new owners to the company\u2019s board. They also alleged oppression and mismanagement. They together claim to hold a 9.43% stake in ABCL and sought to set aside the decisions of new board members of majority shareholders, restrain the majority shareholders from infusing fresh capital, which would help Alanda Media to further consolidate its stake at the cost of minority shareholders.  The tribunal had on September 4 last year passed orders restraining ABCL from selling shares or assets, while responding to a petition by SAIF III Mauritius Company. The fund of SAIF sought to prevent the sale of TV9 by its then majority shareholder and venture capitalist Srini Raju and associates. The fund claimed that the money it had invested 10 years ago in IVision Media, a firm controlled by Srini Raju, were given to ABCL as inter-corporate deposits to help siphon off the money.  Last month, NCLT Hyderabad bench admitted the contempt petition filed by SAIF against Srini Raju and associates, accusing them of selling TV9 for around Rs 460 crore in favour of Alanda Media in violation of the restraining orders.  Raju, who says the tribunal\u2019s orders not to alienate shares and assets were directed at ABCL and not its shareholders, recently offered a compromise deal to SAIF by agreeing to pay Rs 65 crore. Following this, the Mauritius fund informed the tribunal that it would now like to unconditionally withdraw the contempt petition. The tribunal, which heard the case on Monday, reserved its judgment and posted the case for May 23.  While directing NCLT Hyderabad on Thursday to allow SAIF to withdraw its contempt petition, NCLAT ordered the NCLT to specify reasons in case of refusal and not to pass any interim order.

Justice Jayant Nath said prima facie it cannot be concluded that Emami's TV commercial seeks to slander the goods of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL).  \"I conclude that there is no merit in the contention of the senior counsel for the plaintiff (HUL). In my opinion, over all the commercial advertisement does not leave an impression that in any manner disparages the product of the plaintiff. It cannot prima facie be concluded that the said TV commercial seeks to slander the goods of the plaintiff,\" the judge said.  The court passed the order on an application by HUL seeking to restrain Emami from telecasting one of its commercials for the product 'Fair and Handsome', which allegedly disparaged the goodwill and reputation of HUL's product 'Fair & Lovely'.  The interim application was filed in a pending suit of HUL of trademark infringement, disparagement and unfair trade practices allegedly by Emami.  The court listed the main suit for hearing on July 11.  It also said the cream shown in the TV commercial does not resemble HUL's product.  \"In these facts and circumstances, the plaintiff now cannot complain about the TV commercial. The contentions of the plaintiff prima facie have no merits,\" the court said.  Regarding HUL's arguments on disparagement, the court said prima facie there were no merits.  \"The TV commercial no doubt seems to make fun of a male using a ladies cream. Can it be said that this advertisement on account of the said dialogue stated is false or misleading or unfair or deceptive? Does it amount to generic disparagement? The answer is in the negative.  \"In my view, the plaintiff is being over sensitive on the story line of the TV commercial. The defendant had enough room to play around for making the advertisement. In view of the literature that has been posted on its own website by the plaintiff, it also cannot be said that prima facie the statements made in the advertisement regarding using of women's cream by men is false,\" the court said.  HUL had submitted that the ingredient 'niacinamide', used in its product, works in a similar manner on various skins, including men and women, with variable degree of efficiency.  It is common for male consumer to use fairness products available in the market without insisting for the products designed specifically for men and a large number of male consumers are using fairness products designed for men as well as for women skin, it claimed.  To specifically target the male population, in 2006, HUL launched its product 'Fair & Lovely Men', which was later renamed as 'Men's Fair & Lovely'.  HUL claimed that Emami, in its advertisement, makes a false claim that 'Fair & Lovely' was \"rubbish and inefficacious\" and its use was restricted only to women.  It also objected to the colour combination of the tube shown in the advertisement, that is pink and white, as HUL's product is also of the similar colour.  \"This is an attempt to demean, diminish and injure the business of the plaintiff (HUL) while at the same time, seek to expand the business of the defendant (Emami),\" it said.  Defending its advertisement, Emami said the intention behind the advertisement was to inform male consumers that the fairness cream used by female consumers was not effective on their skin, as the texture of male skin was completely different.  It said there was not a whisper regarding HUL's product and also comparison or denigration as alleged.  The court noted that Emami has now changed the colour of the tube shown in the advertisement to white, without a dual face logo, which was materially different from HUL's product.

Epsilon\u2019s services span loyalty programmes to email marketing and its Conversant unit collects consumer data including transactions, location and web activity.  The net purchase price after after a \u201ctax step-up\u201d will $3.95 billion, or 8.2 times 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Publicis Groupe said on Sunday in a statement. A three-way battle for online marketing dollars is underway as ecommerce explodes, pitting the traditional ad companies such as Publicis, WPP and Omnicom Group against global consulting firms and the giant tech platforms: Facebook, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Amazon.com.  The ad firms easily dominated traditional advertising in newspapers, billboards and television before the market went into decline. In the digital world they are up against companies that harvest data from billions of social media users and often get closer to consumers by handling their transactions.  \u201cWith the acquisition of Epsilon, Publicis Groupe is bringing the necessary technology, expertise and the talent to complement our offer in creativity, media and business transformation,\u201d Arthur Sadoun, chief executive officer of Publicis Groupe, said in the statement. Publicis said the acquisition will be fully financed by debt and cash on hand and will suspend its share buyback programme, so that it can stick to its 45% dividend payout ratio pledge.  The owner of agencies Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett Worldwide has a patchy record in managing acquired companies: digital ad technology is evolving rapidly and the group posted a loss in 2016 after writing down the value of one of its digital businesses.  Publicis made one of the industry\u2019s boldest bets on ad technology in 2015 with the $3.7-billion purchase of Boston-based Sapient and Sadoun has staked the company\u2019s future on digital tech businesses that he sees as \u201cstrategic game changers\u201d.  While those parts of the business are growing fast, that wasn\u2019t enough to avoid a fall in sales in the fourth quarter that shocked investors and sent Publicis shares on February 7 to their biggest intraday loss since the September 11. 2001, terror attacks.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Ads may now get more bang for buck in news channels</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Despite an impressive 21% increase in viewership of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) in the first two weeks, data suggests news channels are likely to be a more forceful and cost-effective bet this election season for the advertisers looking for a mass reach.  BARC viewership data sourced from a subscriber showed IPL\u2019s cumulative reach in the 15+ year demographic at 276.4 million (42.5%) in All India and 171.7 million (38.6%) in the Hindi speaking markets (HSM), respectively across 23 Star India channels.  In comparison, the top 20 news channels (five Hindi, three English and top 12 regional language channels) registered a cumulative reach of 291.4 million (44.8%) for All India and 209.2 million (47.1%) for the HSM, respectively. Reach is total number of individuals who viewed the event for at least one minute. The time considered for news channels was between 7 pm and midnight.  While advertising rates for the IPL are at a record Rs 10 lakh per 10-second slot, the same spot on news channels costs a fraction of the amount, which opens up a potential for advertisers, media experts feel.  \u201cNews channels are a very costeffective medium during elections,\u201d said Ashish Sehgal, chief growth officer, advertising revenue at Zee Entertainment Enterprises.  \u201cEspecially during the general elections , we have seen very high level of engagement, as well as reach and frequency. Also, the audience for IPL and news channels is more or less similar with a high skew towards male viewers.\u201d Sehgal, who also looks after the sales for ZEE Group 's news channels, added that news as a genre is still underpriced, making it a \u201clucrative option\u201d for the advertisers.  A back-of-the envelop calculation suggests that if an advertiser puts the same money on top 20 news channels, the gross impressions (or ratings) generated will be around 41% higher for All India market than the IPL.  While IPL has an advantage of being an annual property that has become a part of marketing budgets of many companies, news channels, have not been able to cash in on elections in comparison to the yield one gets in IPL, Sehgal said.  However, some experts also feel that when it comes to engagement, IPL still is unparalleled.  LV Krishnan, CEO, TAM Media Research, said, \u201cGiven the election news presently, there could be some days or limited period of time bands that could have cumulative reach of news channels on a higher level. But, in terms of continuity (time spent) of viewing in a single session, IPL easily scores over news.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">More and more new-age firms are setting up in-house creative teams</h1>", "description": "Mithun Raj\u2019s creative team at Dunzo has a unique problem. Unlike most of their peers in advertising agencies, the team members do not have clients to whine about.  Usually, in an agency-client relationship, the agency proposes (an idea), the client disposes (the idea) until both parties slowly arrive at what they are looking for. \u201cIn talks over beer, my friends from advertising end up complaining about their clients who, they say, are almost never happy with their work,\u201d says Vaidehi Murthy, a copywriter in Raj\u2019s team.  Since Bengaluru-based hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo has an in-house creative team, the agency and the client, or the proposer and the disposer, are the same. Their watering hole and water-cooler conversations, therefore, lack a critical ingredient: resentment.     \u201cToo much liberty is a problem too!\u201d says Raj aka Munz. The 29-year-old is referring to the free hand his team at Dunzo gets from the founders. They get to decide the brand\u2019s ethos and the tone of its voice. In the last one year, his team has led the startup\u2019s rebranding exercise.  This included adding a lightning symbol to the company\u2019s logo and giving a distinct green and black colour scheme to motifs on helmets and jackets the delivery partners wear to work.  Besides this, the team also shoots films, creates social media campaigns, emailers and content for push notifications \u2014 the works. These days, work also means waking up at 6:30 am on Mondays to watch the final season of Game of Thrones. Last week, while social media was abuzz with posts from \u201cTeam Spoilers\u201d and \u201cTeam Anti-Spoilers\u201d, Team Dunzo, picking out sticky dialogues from episode three, put out a post that read: \u201cNot Today. Don\u2019t let your to-do lists drag-on. Stick them with the pointy end. Dunzo #GetItDun.\u201d     Dunzo creating its own creative team is no more a rarity in a business environment where companies tend to hire external agencies for branding work.  Today, up to 12 new-age brands \u2014 such as Paperboat , Bookmyshow, Swiggy and Byju\u2019s \u2014 have put together internal creative units, following a trend started four years ago by Zomato, the Gurgaon-based restaurant search and food delivery platform.  \u201cZomato showed everyone how this model could work really well,\u201d says Sai Ganesh, 35, the marketing lead at Dunzo, who spent more than a year at Zomato as assistant vice-president of marketing. \u201cThey [Zomato] hired people who understood digital branding and marketing when external agencies were still learning the ropes. Some of the people they hired back then are social media celebs now, like Akshar Pathak, Shakti Shetty and Pranav Sapra,\u201d he says.  L to R (standing): Somashekar, Manjunath, Rishiraj, Anshul, Arjun, Deeparaju, Jatin, Nivedita, MaheshL to R (sitting): Ashwini, Aishik, Parameshwar, Shikha, Ciara, Prashant, Manjunatha  Zomato declined a request from ET Magazine to participate in the story. But in an email correspondence with this writer in May 2015, Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal had listed the many merits of building one\u2019s own creative team. \u201cAn in-house creative team can interact seamlessly with various teams, and get a better understanding of the communication that needs to be created. Also, given the pace we\u2019re moving at, having an in-house team drastically cuts down the turnaround time from ideation to execution, and gives us the freedom to iterate quickly and get the work out,\u201d Goyal wrote.  Others who followed Zomato\u2019s lead also talk about the quick turnaround time, better control over content and easy access to every vertical as the benefits of having an in-house team. But unlike Zomato and Dunzo, most of them also continue to have external advertising agency partners too. \u201cYou cannot go to an agency for small recurring problems but that is what we solve through our work on a daily basis,\u201d says Munz of Dunzo.  Ganesh adds: \u201cIn traditional advertising, creatives are often chasing higher metrics, like brand awareness. Here, we chase hard metrics through creative work \u2014 like app installations and transactions.\u201d  Most of these in-house units take care of the company\u2019s content for social media, emailers and push notifications, collectively referred to below-the-line (BTL) advertising. In consumer-tech firms, though, BTL is not something to be dumped onto the basement workers.  BookMyShow, for instance, customises campaigns on the basis of its target audiences and the media they access. \u201cHence, social media and digital platforms are at the centre of our brand communication. TV is a small portion of our marketing spend,\u201d says Marzdi Kalianiwala, the online ticketing platform\u2019s marketing & business intelligence head.     BTL is essential for the company to engage with its 35-million-plus transacting users. A fortnight ago, the ticketing platform\u2019s in-house team of 15 produced a promotional video. It showcased a timeline of all the superheroes featured in Avengers: Endgame to spur more advance bookings for the film and it received rave responses across platforms.  In the case of food delivery startup Swiggy, the in-house unit creates macro storytelling campaigns too. Six months ago, the team rolled out a film called What\u2019s in a name? to urge users to call Swiggy delivery personnel by their names. The film has so far earned more than 21 million views on YouTube and also appears to have changed consumer behaviour, says Shikha Gupta, the startup\u2019s creative director.  \u201cPeople started noticing the names of their cab drivers too,\u201d says the 31-year-old. Sometimes, these in-house teams even collaborate with external partners. Like when the creative team at Paperboat worked with Elephant Design to add witty one-liners to the bottom of its packs. One of them read: \u201cSo. You decided to get to the bottom of this. Here\u2019s our bottom-line. Isn\u2019t it clever?\u201d  Being clever is something all these teams have in common. Their work often gets noticed by people inside and outside the marketing fraternity. The Paperboat lines, for instance, got thumbs up on platforms such as Quora and Reddit.   Clockwise: Sai, Akshita, Parthav, Sajid, Joy, Yathi, Akhil, Munz, Vaidehi, Meghna    External Masters  None of these new-age companies discount the role external agencies play in strengthening brands.  Take, for example, Spring Marketing Capital. All 12 founder-led brands on the Mumbai based firm\u2019s portfolio have in-house creative setups. But for advice on holistic branding strategy, they all come to Spring, which is also an investor in those early-stage technology ventures. \u201cOnline content creation is a skill more companies should eventually build in-house. A brand\u2019s voice needs to come from within,\u201d says Raja Ganapathy, the firm\u2019s founding partner. \u201cBut the core brand positioning, creative idea and its manifestation across online and offline will continue to require external specialists,\u201d he adds.  The sentiment is validated by the likes of Amazon. The ecommerce conglomerate has an internal team of 3,000 designers, 350 of whom work for Amazon India, in areas such as customer research, proposing products, features and communication ideas.  \u201cWe also see that external agencies help in augmenting the resources during peak time and work on a clear brief and on projects that are less exploratory in nature,\u201d says Biju Damodaran, UX design lead at Amazon India. Going forward, Amazon plans to expand its internal design team.  Given the nature of the business, in-house creative teams can sometimes end up with a lot on their plate on a daily basis, says Parvesh Debuka, marketing & sales head at Hector Beverages, which owns the Paperboat brand.    In some cases, they are also better paid than their counterparts in ad agencies. \u201cBut during a full-blown marketing phase, the proportion of work between internal and external creative teams is equal,\u201d says Debuka.  It is also not easy to either set up or run an in-house creative unit. \u201cMotivating yourself and the next person in the team is tough when you are working on just one brand,\u201d says Munz. The thrill of pitching for other brands or working across sectors is definitely missing. \u201cBut our ideas get rejected too,\u201d says Dunzo\u2019s Murthy, almost implying that it is a relief there is some similarity between their lives and the lives of agency folk.  Swiggy\u2019s Gupta also misses the backing of strong client servicing and account planning executives. \u201cBut at least our parents are familiar with the names of the companies we work with now, even if they still don\u2019t understand what it is that we do,\u201d she says.     Munz spams his family WhatsApp group with work his team creates because he is proud to share the creations. Murthy\u2019s father has joined Instagram just to repost all the posts she creates for her company. Then this happened. \u201cThe other day, I walked into my house and saw my mother feeding samosa to a stranger. As I walked closer, I noticed his Tshirt. He was a Dunzo delivery guy.\u201d ", "published_date": "May 05, 2019, 08.04 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:53:40", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/more-and-more-new-age-firms-are-setting-up-in-house-creative/articleshow/69179800.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The Paris-headquartered company plans a series of acquisitions to increase its Indian workforce to around 1,000 by end-2019 from 300.  \u201cThis is the first in the series of acquisitions that are planned and the investments that we are making in India,\u201d Vishnu Mohan, the chief executive for India and South Asia at Havas Group, told ET. \u201cThese acquisitions will help us grow almost three times by the end of this year, both in terms of scale and resources that we would have at our disposal within this company.\u201d  Havas has identified companies in the digital, events and activation spaces for acquisition, and would also want to add capabilities of performance marketing and public relations to its growing business.  \u201cThink Design is poised to be among the largest design innovation consultancies in the world and its addition will further strengthen Havas Group\u2019s integrated offering, ensure an agile, seamless and dynamic service to our clients as well as add greater momentum not just to our India operations but to the network, globally,\u201d Mohan said.  Think Design was founded by Deepali Saini , Hari Nallan and Rama Aleti in 2004. The company now has five design centres in India and one in the US \u2014 Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Denver \u2014 and a team of 125 specialists provide UX vision and design strategy to clients on a global scale to enhance their customer experience.  Think Design\u2019s clients include startups, Fortune 500 companies, government departments and multi-national conglomerates from sectors like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, education, logistics, telecom, media and entertainment. Around 30% of its business comes from overseas markets, primarily North America.  After the takeover, Think Design will become a part of Havas India and Ekino Global, Havas\u2019 digital transformation agency.  \u201cAt Ekino, we do what we call the digital transformation, through design and technology. With the acquisition, we are going to connect Think Design\u2019s client portfolio and expertise to our technology capabilities so that Think Design can deliver end-to-end services from design to delivering the digital solution,\u201d said Ekino chief executive Yann Doussot.  Think Design CEO Nallan said the founder trio will continue to work with the company. \u201cWe have always believed that collaboration with the right minds can lead to the greatest results. During our conversations with the Havas leadership, we experienced a very strong connection and equally great synergy. We have no doubt that Think Design\u2019s integration into Havas Group will help us become an even stronger, global force to reckon with,\u201d he said.  Havas, which has been lagging behind international and local communication networks like GroupM, IPG Mediabrands, Dentsu Aegis Network and Madison, has become aggressive in India in the last one year. It has appointed Rana Barua and Bobby Pawar as the Group CEO, and chairman and CCO, respectively.

Refering to the latest report by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the company in a statement said it \"continues to be the market leader with a subscriber base of 1,02,606 as of March 2015\". This figure translates into a cumulative market share at \"an all-time high of 43.42 per cent among VSAT service providers in India\", it added. The company said: \"HCIL reported its 12-month market share at 59 per cent for 2014-15, with banking and rural installations as the key drivers of growth, followed by other high-value applications such as e-learning, digital cinema, energy and government.\" It attributed a significant portion of HCIL's growth to the banking sector's retail expansion by way of ATMs linked to the Prime Minister's financial inclusion campaign. \"A notable achievement was the collaboration with the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), a partnership that saw Hughes roll out an e-governance project under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) in 468 blocks across the country,\" HCIL, a subsidiary of Hughes Network Systems , said. HCIL President and MD Partho Banerjee said these are \"exciting times\" for HCIL and the Indian VSAT industry overall as it has emerged as one of the key pillars of the digital India mandate. \"The government's financial inclusion programme has given a major boost to banking growth across the nation, and we see sustained growth as well in e-learning and e-governance,\" he added.", "published_date": "Sep 15, 2015, 02.03 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:53:40", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/Hughes-Communications-becomes-largest-service-provider-with-59-market-share/articleshow/48969407.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

With this, HCIL becomes the first company to be granted the Flight and Maritime Connectivity (FMC) licence in India by the telecom department, after the government notified rules for in-flight, maritime mobile phone services in December last year.  HCIL is a majority-owned subsidiary of broadband network and services provider Hughes Network Systems.  \"The first company to be granted the FMC licence in India, HCIL is now authorised to provide in-flight connectivity and high-quality broadband services to Indian and foreign airlines and shipping companies operating within Indian territory,\" HCIL said in a statement.  The company has already set up a base mobility platform and is in talks to enhance the services in India, it added. The statement did not divulge details about potential tie-ups with specific airlines, likely tariffs, or timeframe in which the services could be available.  A source however said the connectivity could be in place in about three months for in-flight services, and before that for ships.  Once the alliances with airlines are in place, travellers will be able to stay connected during a flight with internet access and possibly also have voice services through apps during air travel within Indian territory, the source said.  The FMC licence has been granted for a period of 10 years, and HCIL will pay spectrum charges based on revenue earned from providing these services, which can be delivered using both satellites and telecom networks on the ground.  HCIL will provide FMC services in India operating over domestic and foreign satellites permitted by the Department of Space, the statement said.  Since the policy was first published by regulatory authorities in mid-December 2018, it has generated a lot of interest from India's maritime and airline industries and HCIL looks forward to supporting them in the rapidly growing opportunity for in-flight and maritime connectivity services, the statement said.  Commenting on the development, Partho Banerjee, President & Managing Director at Hughes Communications India said: \"We stand ready operationally to initiate high quality broadband services for both airlines and maritime operators, including having the availability of ubiquitous satellite coverage across Indian airspace and territorial waters\".  According to Euroconsult, over 23,000 commercial aircraft will offer connectivity to their passengers by 2027, up from 7,400 aircraft in 2017.  Northern Sky Research's Aeronautical SatCom Market's 2017 report predicts that by the end of 2019, broadband VSAT connectivity will be installed on one out of every three commercial passenger aircraft and will rise to two out of every three by the end of 2026.  Fuelled by rising demand for broadband connectivity, this installed base is estimated to generate over USD 32 billion in revenue over the next decade, as air travel continues its rise around the world.  The connectivity needs in maritime industry are also growing leaps and bounds.  An increasing number of vessels are looking to stay connected to provide their crew and passengers high-speed internet access, monitoring weather patterns to cut fuel costs, filing regulatory documents, ordering supplies from sea to save time in port, and generating business intelligence.

These consumers had opted for long-duration packs before the new tariff order set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India came into effect in February.  Many such consumers believed they would not have to pay extra for their favourite TV channels until the validity of their existing packs ended.  However, they are now in a fix as DTH operators terminated the contracts of consumers who did not opt to select channels of their choice.  Consumers flooded the regulator with complaints against DTH operators including Tata Sky , Sun Direct and Independent TV (formerly Reliance Digital TV ), people aware of the matter said. Following this, Trai issued a directive on May 1, asking DTH operators to honour the long-duration packs if a consumer hadn\u2019t selected channels.    However, Tata Sky approached the Delhi high court against Trai\u2019s directive and got a stay on Wednesday. The matter will come up for hearing on July 11.  \u201cThe problem is multi-fold,\u201d said a senior executive in a DTH company who did not wish to be identified. \u201cAt one end, Trai directed us to migrate all the consumers to the new regime or a \u2018best fit plan\u2019 based on their existing packages, while after getting a backlash, it is now also asking us to honour the long-duration packs. This will create confusion.\u201d There\u2019s another aspect. The new broadcast framework ended the earlier revenue-sharing model between DTH companies and broadcasters, making it unviable to offer 200-300 channels for the same price.  A senior broadcaster said DTH operators are suffering because all broadcasters have decided to charge subscribers on the basis on the new tariff order. \u201cIf they want to, or have to, give channels as per the old arrangement, they will have to shell out money from their pockets,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are suffering here,\u201d SK Gupta, Trai secretary, told ET.  While he refused to disclose what action the regulator will take, stating that the matter is sub judice, he said DTH operators should have informed subscribers in advance of the possibility of change in their plans.  \u201cThey knew that the new tariff order will be implemented from a certain date. They could have put a disclaimer. They took a calculated risk - now why should consumer suffer?\u201d Gupta asked. Tata Sky CEO Harit Nagpal declined to comment, saying the matter is sub judice.  Tata Sky argued in court that Trai\u2019s new directive contradicts its own framework and would result in two parallel regimes, which will expose distribution platform operators to huge losses. Trai told cable and DTH companies on February 12 to migrate consumers to the new tariff regime by offering them a best-fit plan based on the packs they had paid for.

This represents growth of over 19% for ET, compared with the total growth of 14% in the English newspaper category.  Across business newspapers, ET is ahead by more than half of the combined readership of the other four newspapers \u2014 Hindu Business Line , Business Standard , Mint and Financial Express \u2014 which have a total readership of less than 2.4 million.  Total readership (TR) is the number of readers who have read the newspaper at least once in the previous 30 days, while average issue readership (AIR) is the number of readers who have read the paper the previous day. ET\u2019s AIR has increased by 5% to 983,000 readers. This represents an increase of 45,000 daily readers. All other business newspapers together have an AIR of 647,000. That\u2019s 52% lower than ET\u2019s daily readership.   80% of ET Readers from NCCS A Category  Till the time of filing this story IRS had not released the data for Hindustan Times, so ET currently appears at No 3 in the all-India rankings for English dailies.     The gains in total readership have come primarily from the top cities \u2014 400,000 of the 600,000 new readers have come from Mumbai, Delhi (including Gurgaon), Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Over 75% have come from the coveted NCCS A socio-economic category. Over a third of the new readers belong to the elite NCCS A1 category. As a result, 80% of ET\u2019s total readers now belong to the NCCS A category. Over 60% of the new readers are young, below the age of 30 years, and a total of nearly 500,000 of the 600,000 new readers are below the age of 40 years.  Reflecting the newspaper\u2019s longstanding focus on emerging businesses and its dedicated coverage of startups and the new economy segments, ET\u2019s share of young readers (below 40 years) has jumped to 73%. Despite ET\u2019s high reader base, over 89% of our readers do not read any other business paper and only 14% spend less than 15 minutes on the paper (the lowest percentage for any business paper). Over 85% of our readers spend more than 15 minutes with the paper on any given day.  Out of the top five English dailies, three were from the Times Group, with The Times of India leading the pack with a TR of 15.23 million and AIR of 5.65 million. ET was at number three (without HT data), while Mumbai Mirror was placed fourth with TR of 2.16 million and AIR of 800,000.  The survey considers population of over 12 years of age across urban and rural India. The reporting sample size for this survey was 324,000 households.  IRS data shows that in contrast to the global trend where print media is on a slippery wicket, Indians still like to read newspapers as well as magazines.  The IRS Q1 2019 data includes the annual total of three quarters of IRS 2017 and Q1 fieldwork of IRS 2019 (December 2018 \u2013 April 2019).  As per the survey, the number of overall readers, who have read any daily in the last 30 days, has gone up to 425 million, as against 407 million in IRS 2017. Interestingly, urban and rural markets have added an equal number of readers \u2013 9 million each \u2013 to the total addition of 18 million.  When it comes to languages, Hindi readers have gone up by 10 million, while regional and English dailies have seen an increase of 8 million and 3 million, respectively. Total number of readers of Hindi, English and regional newspapers have gone up to 186 million, 31 million and 211 million, respectively, as per the data.  Also, out of the total universe, 37.3% of the readers have stated that they have read a newspaper in the previous 30 days, up from 36.8% in the last survey. Meanwhile, 27% of the 24 million most affluent consumers (NCCS A1) are now reading newspapers online. For All India, the number is 5%, while for cities it is at 9%.  Among magazines, total readers have grown from 78 million in the previous survey to 87 million.  On the quarterly release of data, Ashish Bhasin, CEO \u2013 Greater South, Dentsu Aegis Network, and chairman, MRUC, said, \u201cThis was something that the industry was expecting from IRS over the past several years. Quarterly release of data will enhance the ability of the IRS to mirror the changing media and marketing landscape of India in a more timely and realistic manner.\u201d  Vikram Sakhuja, chairman of the IRS Technical Committee, added, \u201cThe data is robust and representative of the diversity and heterogeneity of our wonderful country.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India , which had earlier warned of action against operators found to be flouting the new tariff order and regulatory regime, said that audits in this regard will begin soon.  \"BECIL will be conducting the audit on behalf of TRAI to ensure compliance with the new regulatory framework. We request all distribution platform operators (DPOs) to ensure compliance with the new regulatory framework in letter and spirit,\" TRAI Secretary S K Gupta told .  Gupta said that a decision is being taken on the companies that would face the audit of systems.  \"DTH and Cable TV operators will be randomly selected and audit will be conducted to see if they are in compliance with the new regulatory framework,\" he said.  It is pertinent to mention here that over the last few days, TRAI has pulled up a number of operators, both Cable TV and DTH service providers, for violation of rules, as it acted on consumer complaints pertaining to specific offerings, grievance redressal helplines, and arbitrary migration of subscribers with valid long-term packs to new plans.  In some of the cases, TRAI noted that the players were forcing channels and package schemes to the consumers, and subscribers were not able to exercise their choice.  Most recently, TRAI rapped direct-to-home (DTH) operators Tata Sky, Dish TV , and Sun Direct TV, for failing to abide by the rules, particularly pertaining to the migration of subscribers who had long-term packs.  TRAI Chairman R S Sharma had, last month, said that the regulator plans to initiate \"audit\" of subscriber management and other IT systems of errant operators. Sharma had said consumer choice and consumer interest are \"non-negotiable\" and \"cannot be compromised\" and that companies not adhering to rules will have to face the consequences.  The audit planned by TRAI will look at multiple aspects including subscriber management system and billing, and also determine whether consumers are indeed getting their choice of channels, be it bouquets or a la carte.  \"The audits will start very soon,\" Gupta said.  Trai has unveiled a new tariff order and regulatory regime for the broadcast and cable sector to facilitate consumers to opt for channels they wish to view and pay only for them. It had said every channel should be offered a la carte, with a transparent display of rates on electronic programme guide.

Producer of films such as Rang De Basanti, Jodha Akbar and Barfi, Screwvala had taken a back seat in filmmaking after selling his company in 2012. But now with RSVP, Screwvala is keen on building the creative team in-house and have his own scripts. Unlike earlier, content, and not scale and number of titles, will be priority, he told ET.  \u201cWe have a clear vision on what scripts we will green-light to be made into movies with the right directors. These will be either real life stories or stories we would love to tell, like Kabaddi, or stories which people would go to the movie screens for,\u201d Screwvala said. RSVP is working on movies based on the life on Sam Manekshaw and Ram Jethmalani , and also on the Uri attacks and surgical strikes that followed.  Screwvala, however, said his core commitment will remain with Swades Foundation, the non-profit group he started with his wife, Zarina, and online education company UpGrad , which he wants to build with impact.  For the first film under the RSVP banner, Love Per Square Foot , Screwvala has decided to go digital and not release the film in theatres. Screwvala, however, clarified that there\u2019s no plan to create movies for the digital platform only. He, however, noted that shortening theatrical window and digital premiers of films is a threat for the industry and that it\u2019s time for multiplexes and content makers to have a dialogue.  \u201cMultiplexes need to be partners in increasing footfalls, but they have been too focused \u2014 maybe rightly so \u2014 in expanding their footprint of screens, because we are such an under-screened country. But it is definitely a time for a very serious dialogue between creators and exhibitors to see this as a common problem, which is only going to worsen,\u201d he said.  Screwvala said the film industry has done nothing to grow and focus on the theatrical segment, but has done more damage in the last five years. \u201cThe results speak for themselves, as footfalls have flattened and, in fact, decreased. Overall, all theatrical chains\u2019 growth is coming from new capital investment and new theatres.  \u201cMost people, who used to watch around 12 movies a year, now choose to watch just three or four. So unless the industry actually takes stock and stops this trend and ensures that collectively no movie is on a nontheatrical platform for at least six months, this will only shrink further,\u201d he said.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">New government to take up BSNL, MTNL revival plans: Sources</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The Finance Ministry has asked the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to re-examine the revival proposals for the telecom firms BSNL and MTNL and submit these to the new government that will take office after the ongoing general elections, a senior official source said on Tuesday.  This implies, according to the source, that there is no immediate move, in the next few months till a new government settles down, to revive both central public sector enterprises ( CPSEs ).  Last month, the DoT had floated a draft cabinet note for consultation among ministries on the revival of BSNL and MTNL.  In response, the Finance Ministry has now asked the DoT to rework the proposals, indicating both the steps and the financial outgo involved and submit these to the new government.  The two key issues in the revival proposal are the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and allocation of 4G spectrum.  According to the source, both Finance Ministry and DoT are of the view that there may not be any need to consider financial support to the companies for VRS since the employees of these telcos are covered by the government pension rules relevant for CPSEs carved out of ministries.  Both BSNL and MTNL have been carved out of DoT.  The issue of allocation of 4G spectrum has also been left for consideration of the next government at the Centre, the source added.  Another key component of the revival proposal concerns the monetisation of the assets of BSNL and MTNL.  According to the source, it is to yet to be decided as to who, between the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management ( DIPAM ) and the DoT, will carry out the mutation process involved in monetising assets.  Mutation is the recording of a transfer of title of a property from one person to another in the revenue records. The documentation procedure to be followed and the fee payable in mutation varies from state to state.  DIPAM has a asset monetisation framework which lays down the procedures for the administrative ministries to follow in selling off CPSE assets.  The titles to the lands and buildings of BSNL and MTNL are still with the DoT.  Both companies have sought spectrum for 4G services through equity infusion from the government.  BSNL, which has the lowest debt of Rs 14,000 crore among all telecom operators, has sought 4G spectrum across India through equity infusion of Rs 7,000 crore. The total cost of the spectrum will be Rs 14,000 crore.  Both firms have asked for a VRS for employees similar to the Gujarat model.  The VRS scheme for BSNL and MTNL will have a respective revenue impact of Rs 6,365 crore and Rs 2,120 crore.

At a two-hour long review meeting with the promoters and chief executives of these companies on Tuesday, RS Sharma, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), said broadcasters will be directed to black out channels to distribution platform operators (DPOs) in case the new tariff order is not implemented, according to a company executive who attended the meeting.  \u201cThe chairman, in no uncertain terms, told all the present players to take the regulator seriously,\u201d the executive said. \u201cAlready in the previous meeting, secretary SK Gupta had warned that Trai may recommend revoking of licence of erring distribution platforms.\u201d  Another executive said that most of the DPOs are ready for the migration. \u201cTata Sky is the only player which is waiting for the hearing in the high court and has not started to reach out to its consumers, and Airtel Digital TV is way behind mark.

ET had reported on Tuesday that more than 50% of consumers are yet to exercise their right to select the channels of their choice. Trai had asked DPOs to reach out to their subscribers by January 21.  Trai had notified the new tariff order and regulatory framework for the broadcast sector on December 29 to allow consumers to decide on which channels they want to watch and pay only for them. It said every channel must be offered \u00e0 la carte, with the price displayed on the electronic programme guide.  Broadcasters and DPOs are allowed to offer bouquets of channels, but their prices are to be published transparently.  Sharma also said that the review meetings to monitor the progress will continue.

According to Raju, who, along with others, invested nearly Rs 100 crore in ABCL in various tranches, is expecting nearly 4X return on the investment. \"The process is on.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Trai keen on audit of spectrum held by government</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) wants the government to identify spectrum being held by various departments and agencies for effective commercial application of the scarce natural resource.  \u201cIn order to ensure the availability of spectrum and appropriate utilisation, the Department of Telecom (DoT) should carry out studies on its usage and necessity so that various departments holding a scarce resource can use it in a right manner,\u201d Trai Chairman Ram Sewak Sharma told ET.  Other than telecom services, nearly 60% of identified spectrum is held by various departments and their agencies for the use of FM radio and DTH TV, satellite and space communication, aeronautical navigation, and defence communication services.  The regulator added that if spectrum was not put to use optimally and efficiently, it might result in not only financial loss to the government but also hinder economic and social development of the country.  Trai believes that such a perishable natural resource should be suitably deployed and the unused radio waves should be allowed for sale for commercial purposes.     In its auction recommendations to the government last August, the watchdog said various government agencies were allocated spectrum administratively and that should be put to optimal use, adding that it had suggested an audit on many occasions.  Trai, through this exercise, also wants to draw up a schedule for the release of suitable frequencies to the telecom sector for effective mobile telephony and broadband services in the country.  With the exponential growth in data led by video content and in the anticipation of the fifth-generation or 5G-based telecom services, telcos have been demanding more frequencies across bands to be put on the table. The service providers have often attributed poor service quality including call drops to the unavailability of sufficient spectrum.  \u201cThere is an urgent need of audit for all allocated spectrum both commercial as well as spectrum allocated to various public sector undertakings or government organisations. This should be done by an independent agency,\u201d Trai said earlier.  Meanwhile, the departments of space and broadcasting were principally against the idea of sharing spectrum utilisation details, according to an industry source.  The country\u2019s National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) indicates radio waves allocation, and according to it, 87.5Mhz-108MHz spectrum band is used for FM radio broadcasts, 230Mhz-450Mhz for satellite communication, aeronautical navigation and outdoor broadcast vans, 585Mhz -698Mhz is taken for TV broadcast.

Screwvala has proposed to be the principal witness in the investigation.  Screwvala\u2019s Mumbai-based movie production company RSVP, a part of Unilazer Ventures, has also included Multiplex Association of India (MAI) as one of the respondents in its complain.  Screwvala alleged that these exhibitors continue their illegal and malafide act of imposing VPF, using a standard non-negotiable revenue model and holding back advance payments that they get from online portals for movies.  VPF was first introduced to help make multiplexes DCI compliant, a technology that helps to reduce cost, curbs piracy and enhances the movie viewing experience. Since the technology was costly, it was agreed that multiplex chains will charge Rs 20,000 per screen for each movie for five years to recover that cost, beginning from 2010.  \u201cVPF was to be charged only for a period of five years, by when the multiplexes were to amortise the cost incurred by them in adopting the technology for digitisation of the theatres. Three years have passed since the completion of this original sunset period of five years, but multiplexes have continued to impose VPF, without any regard for such sunset provision,\u201d said the complaint.  \u201cThis discriminatory charge of VPF is only to the domestic/Indian language films, while all Hollywood /international movies are exempted owing to an understanding /global release agreement sign by the multiplex chains,\u201d the complaint said.  It also alleged that multiplex owners are in unilateral control of the showcasing of the movies. \u201cThe OP (opposite parties) alone determine how many shows a film gets and they reduce the show at their discretion without any regard to the producer or the film.  The 143-page complaint filed by law firm DSK Legal that ET reviewed said \u201cThe multiplex owners obtain large sums as cash advances from e-commerce companies involved in cinema bookings. However, this amount is not passed on to the content creators. There is significant delay in paying content creator companies.\u201d  RSVP, which made movies including \u2018Uri: The Surgical Strike\u2019 and \u2018Sonchiraiya,\u2019 has also alleged that multiplex companies along with their association are in the violation of Section 3 (1) of Competition Act that prohibits any form of cartelisation that impacts adversely on competition or fair market within India.  As per the Competition Act, the maximum penalty for cartelisation is three times a company\u2019s profit or 10% of its turnover, whichever is higher.

It said the level of impact on the MSOs and DTH players will depend on their geographical diversity with regard to subscribers, the relative attractiveness of the market, and current tariffs and service offerings.  The impact will be visible only in fiscal year 2019-2020 even though the service rollout is slated to happen from August 15 this year. Aggressive posturing by Jio for market penetration will be \"credit negative\" for existing players, it said.  RIL announced Jiogigafibre, the broadband offering, at its shareholder meeting last week but details such as the pricing are not yet revealed. The company plans to initially launch the offering in 1,100 cities.  It can be noted that the deep-pocketed Jio 's entry has wrecked the telecom sector, resulting in mergers, bankruptcy filings, market withdrawals and profits plummeting for entrenched players. Jio made voice, which contributed over 70 per cent of revenues, free, and started off by offering services for free and then announced aggressive plans.  The agency said penetration levels are low in India as compared to other countries globally, with only 7 per cent of the 290 million households having fixed broadband and 180 million TV households. It said Jio's target of 50 million households is only 18 per cent of the households, and \"achievable\".  At the current monthly broadband tariff of Rs 500-600 per household, the potential market size for 50 million households could be Rs 30,000-36,000 crore, significant portion of which could be tapped by Jio, it said.  The last mile connectivity will be a challenge for the country's largest corporate as it rolls out the fibre-based broadband offering, it said welcoming the phased rollout strategy which Jio is planning.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Indian Readership Survey foxes media industry</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Much has been written about anomalies in the 2013 round of the IRS, India\u2019s largest and only readership survey, the findings of which are currently barred from release by a Delhi High Court order. For the uninitiated, here are the highlights \u2014 readership of most newspapers is less than their circulation; publications are fast vanishing from their strongholds; and there are large chunks of \u201creaders\u201d in the survey who claim to be \u201cilliterates\u201d. But even as most newspaper titles across genres show sharp declines, one media group has surprisingly bucked the trend across the board with a uniformly upward trajectory \u2014 the Hindustan Times group. Amongst the English national dailies, for instance, Hindustan Times saw its readership grow 13%. The three other top dailies (which had combined circulation almost three times that of HT in the 2012 round), all saw drops in readership. The Times of India fell by 5%, The Hindu by a staggering 32% and The Telegraph by a huge 26%. As per IRS 2013, HT contributes 28% of the top four papers\u2019 circulation \u2014 up from 20% just a year ago. \u201cMost publishers know that the HT figures are absurd,\u201d said Malcolm Mistry, CEO of DNA, an English daily published in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Jaipur and Pune. \u201cOur own publication's figures are lower than our subscribers. Certainly there\u2019s some serious problem in the measurement.\u201d The story\u2019s the same when it comes to financial dailies. The No 1 paper, The Economic Times, dropped readership by 2% according to IRS 2013, while The Hindu Business Line fell 14% and Business Standard dropped 13%. In such a seemingly unpromising market, Mint (HT Media\u2019s financial paper) apparently experienced a 38% hike in readership. Even among the leading Hindi dailies, every major title is shown as losing readers \u2014 Dainik Jagran\u2019s numbers are down by 5%, Dainik Bhaskar by 11% and Amar Ujala by 16%. Bucking that trend, HT group\u2019s Hindustan has shown a 16% spike in readership. If it wasn\u2019t odd enough that the HT group has managed to buck national readership trends across its Hindi, English and business dailies, it\u2019s done the same when it comes to another key statistic, readership per copy, or RPC (simply, the number of readers who read one copy of the publication). The RPC of Hindustan Times, for instance, is a staggering 17 readers per copy in Noida, and 12 in Gurgaon. This is similar for key markets such as Mumbai and Delhi as well for HT and Mint, which has an RPC that\u2019s double that of its nearest competitor in Delhi. Similarly, Hindustan has an RPC of 5.5, more than double that of rival dailies. HT Media , a competitor of the Times Group which publishes The Times of India, The Economic Times and Navbharat Times, did not respond to emailed queries for this story. Media buyers and publishers are refusing to believe this readership and RPC numbers. Mallikarjun Das, CEO of Starcom MediaVest Group, India, says: \u201cForget the fact that these numbers don\u2019t make sense. The fundamental issue that they should've taken head on is that there's a greater need to have an industry body that studies the determinants that lead to differences in RPC. There could be all kinds of hypothesis like one publication distributes it in parlours where it gets picked up by more users. The point is all these determinants need to be studied and taken into consideration for these numbers to be considered valid.\u201d Mahendra Mohan Gupta, chairman and MD of Dainik Jagran Group, said the figures have been fudged and the results manipulated. Proof of this was detailed in a representation by publishers to the agencies that conducted the survey--Media Research Users Council (MRUC) and Readership Studies Council of India (RSCI). The publishers pushed the agencies to set up a committee to review the results. Ravi Dhariwal, CEO of the Times Group, said, \u201cThe process of fieldwork in IRS is nowhere as tamper-proof as it should have been. We know of several areas where data could have been tampered with and have sent our concerns repeatedly to the IRS management.\u201d The two agencies are waiting for the new, revised report to be released to determine the level of intervention required in the IRS methodology, or indeed, if an entire reboot of the current round of research is warranted. It will be recalled that the merger of the IRS and National Readership Survey (NRS) was first proposed in 2009 and came about in 2011, promising much more robust, technologically sound findings. However, the complications of competing methodologies appear to have been a lot easier to resolve when set alongside the long delays being experienced by publishers and media agencies alike ever since the unification. According to the schedule, the numbers for the first quarter of 2014 should have been released by now with fieldwork for the second quarter underway. Instead, the industry has its hands full trying to unravel the 2013 numbers. For now, the aggrieved publishers are hoping the revised results will be a much fairer reflection of reality.", "published_date": "Jun 13, 2014, 04.50 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:54:05", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/Indian-Readership-Survey-foxes-media-industry/articleshow/36456134.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

This would ensure that 25 per cent discount is passed on to the readers,\" an official statement said, adding that the policy has come into effect from December 31 last year. Acknowledging growing prospects of e-commerce in the publications domain, the policy also promotes sale of e-books of the Division through online platforms. As per the policy, the revenue earned from sales of digital books would be shared in the ratio of 70:30, between the Publications Division and e-commerce platform respectively. While a performance review of e-commerce platforms would also be done after two years for any further action, it has also rationalised the pricing mechanism of key journals and magazines based on a formula, incorporating production costs and discounts. \"The policy framework focuses on participation of critical stakeholders like agents, distributors and institutions making bulk purchase through discount slabs, credit and exchange facility. \"It provides different discount slabs for books, journals and employment news based on the monetary limit of the order and the number of copies respectively,\" the statement said. National-level book publishing organisations like National Book Trust interested in selling the publications of the Division would be covered under the agent's discount rate of 45 percent, it said. The policy will allow credit facility to agents proportionate to their earnest money deposit with sixty days of credit which could be enhanced against suitable fixed deposit. \"The exchange facility to agents would be allowed within 60 days of billing up to 10 per cent of the gross value of the publications purchased in a year. \"However, this facility would be provided only two times in a calendar year and the exchange would not be applicable for the annual reference book India/Bharat,\" it said.", "published_date": "Jan 22, 2016, 07.23 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:54:06", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/Centre-promotes-online-readership-as-part-of-new-policy/articleshow/50686739.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

This is the latest tactic by the cable and direct-to-home (DTH) companies to speed up the migration process to the new tariff regime.  Out of the 165-170 million cable and satellite households in India, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) has said that only 90 million have migrated to the new regime so far.  For the uninitiated, Trai had directed the distribution operators (cable and DTH companies) to migrate their consumers on to the new tariff order regime \u2014 where the consumer will select and pay only for the channels they want to watch \u2014 by February 1.  And while Trai has asked the operators not to switch off the signals, multiple executives and consumers have confirmed to ET that some channels are being switched off. \u201cAll the distribution platforms have agreed that the best way to speed up the process is by removing some popular channels,\u201d said a senior executive of a large multi-system operator (MSO). \u201cWe have been switching off channels in various cities; it has forced consumers out of their inertia and call their local cable operators.\u201d Consumers across Mumbai , Kolkata, Indore , Bhopal, Agra , Gwalior and other cities have been facing this issue. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t watch Sunday\u2019s India-New Zealand match because our cable operator removed the sports channel from our package,\u201d said BN Banerjee, a retired school teacher from Kolkata. Further, it is learned that broadcasters have decided to start billing as per the new tariff starting February 14 and, hence, consumers who have not decided or opted for the pay channels will be downgraded to basic free-to-air (FTA) packs.  \u201cThere will not be a blackout, but distribution platforms have taken a conscious call to downgrade subscribers to either FTA, in case of post-paid billing, or best-fit packages in case of prepaid billing, post February 14,\u201d said the CEO of a large MSO.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) in a statement Friday, said it has sought comments by May 20 instead of April 29, and counter-comments by June 3 instead of May 13, following requests from stakeholders.  In a consultation paper, floated on March 29, Trai had sought industry views on aspects such as validity of such registration to the charges, connectivity, interconnectivity aspects and even security conditions.  Trai had also invited stakeholder views on whether the definition of application service in context of OSPs needs to be changed and whether the application services which are purely based on data/ internet should be covered under application service for the purpose of defining OSP.  The Trai paper had said that as per current definition, an OSP is a company providing application services such as telebanking , telemedicine, tele-education, tele-trading, ecommerce, call centre, network operation centre and other IT enabled services by using telecom resources or infrastructure provided by licensed telecom operators.  Trai had also sought to know if any other regulatory framework \u2013 rather than the current registration process for a fee - be adopted for OSPs so that the purpose of registration specified by government is met.  The consultation paper had come in the backdrop of the telecom department\u2019s (DoT) reference last September seeking a recommendation from the regulator on the matter. In a letter to the regulator last year, DoT had underlined that the time had come to devise a technology-neutral framework so as to promote innovations for setting up the OSP service delivery platform in a most cost-efficient manner, for faster promotion of these service providers.

This paves the way for mobile number portability service providers Syniverse Tech and MNP Interconnection to claim Rs 120 crore of dues from telcos.  The Mukesh Ambani-led telco had on April 1appealed against the court\u2019s March 8 verdict that junked a 15-month-old Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) regulation cutting per port transaction charge to Rs 4, from Rs 19. The high court had called Trai\u2019s regulation illegal.  Jio said mobile number portability (MNP) service providers had suppressed information relating to porting fees, and \u201cthird-party (read: telco) interests are likely to be affected\u201d if its claims are not accepted.  Syniverse Tech and MNP Interconnection said they had consistently kept telcos, including Jio, in the loop that the reduced porting fee of Rs 4 was sub judice. The Delhi High Court, in an order dated May 3, said the \u201creview petitioner\u2019s (Jio) complaint about being unfairly kept out of the proceedings is not borne out\u201d as invoices show the MNP service providers revealed to telcos that \u201cthe per port transaction charge fixed at Rs 4 was under challenge.\u201d  The stakes are high as dismissal of Jio\u2019s appeal paves the way for both MNP service providers to recover roughly Rs 120 crore of porting free arrears retrospectively from February 2018 from telcos.  \u201cDelhi High Court\u2019s March 8 verdict was well written, and its subsequent May 3 order, has removed all ambiguity that PPTC has remained Rs 19 since the beginning,\u201d Himanshu Goel, managing director (India, Middle East & Africa), Syniverse, told ET.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Indian Readership Survey foxes media industry</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Much has been written about anomalies in the 2013 round of the IRS, India\u2019s largest and only readership survey, the findings of which are currently barred from release by a Delhi High Court order. For the uninitiated, here are the highlights \u2014 readership of most newspapers is less than their circulation; publications are fast vanishing from their strongholds; and there are large chunks of \u201creaders\u201d in the survey who claim to be \u201cilliterates\u201d. But even as most newspaper titles across genres show sharp declines, one media group has surprisingly bucked the trend across the board with a uniformly upward trajectory \u2014 the Hindustan Times group. Amongst the English national dailies, for instance, Hindustan Times saw its readership grow 13%. The three other top dailies (which had combined circulation almost three times that of HT in the 2012 round), all saw drops in readership. The Times of India fell by 5%, The Hindu by a staggering 32% and The Telegraph by a huge 26%. As per IRS 2013, HT contributes 28% of the top four papers\u2019 circulation \u2014 up from 20% just a year ago. \u201cMost publishers know that the HT figures are absurd,\u201d said Malcolm Mistry, CEO of DNA, an English daily published in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Jaipur and Pune. \u201cOur own publication's figures are lower than our subscribers. Certainly there\u2019s some serious problem in the measurement.\u201d The story\u2019s the same when it comes to financial dailies. The No 1 paper, The Economic Times, dropped readership by 2% according to IRS 2013, while The Hindu Business Line fell 14% and Business Standard dropped 13%. In such a seemingly unpromising market, Mint (HT Media\u2019s financial paper) apparently experienced a 38% hike in readership. Even among the leading Hindi dailies, every major title is shown as losing readers \u2014 Dainik Jagran\u2019s numbers are down by 5%, Dainik Bhaskar by 11% and Amar Ujala by 16%. Bucking that trend, HT group\u2019s Hindustan has shown a 16% spike in readership. If it wasn\u2019t odd enough that the HT group has managed to buck national readership trends across its Hindi, English and business dailies, it\u2019s done the same when it comes to another key statistic, readership per copy, or RPC (simply, the number of readers who read one copy of the publication). The RPC of Hindustan Times, for instance, is a staggering 17 readers per copy in Noida, and 12 in Gurgaon. This is similar for key markets such as Mumbai and Delhi as well for HT and Mint, which has an RPC that\u2019s double that of its nearest competitor in Delhi. Similarly, Hindustan has an RPC of 5.5, more than double that of rival dailies. HT Media , a competitor of the Times Group which publishes The Times of India, The Economic Times and Navbharat Times, did not respond to emailed queries for this story. Media buyers and publishers are refusing to believe this readership and RPC numbers. Mallikarjun Das, CEO of Starcom MediaVest Group, India, says: \u201cForget the fact that these numbers don\u2019t make sense. The fundamental issue that they should've taken head on is that there's a greater need to have an industry body that studies the determinants that lead to differences in RPC. There could be all kinds of hypothesis like one publication distributes it in parlours where it gets picked up by more users. The point is all these determinants need to be studied and taken into consideration for these numbers to be considered valid.\u201d Mahendra Mohan Gupta, chairman and MD of Dainik Jagran Group, said the figures have been fudged and the results manipulated. Proof of this was detailed in a representation by publishers to the agencies that conducted the survey--Media Research Users Council (MRUC) and Readership Studies Council of India (RSCI). The publishers pushed the agencies to set up a committee to review the results. Ravi Dhariwal, CEO of the Times Group, said, \u201cThe process of fieldwork in IRS is nowhere as tamper-proof as it should have been. We know of several areas where data could have been tampered with and have sent our concerns repeatedly to the IRS management.\u201d The two agencies are waiting for the new, revised report to be released to determine the level of intervention required in the IRS methodology, or indeed, if an entire reboot of the current round of research is warranted. It will be recalled that the merger of the IRS and National Readership Survey (NRS) was first proposed in 2009 and came about in 2011, promising much more robust, technologically sound findings. However, the complications of competing methodologies appear to have been a lot easier to resolve when set alongside the long delays being experienced by publishers and media agencies alike ever since the unification. According to the schedule, the numbers for the first quarter of 2014 should have been released by now with fieldwork for the second quarter underway. Instead, the industry has its hands full trying to unravel the 2013 numbers. For now, the aggrieved publishers are hoping the revised results will be a much fairer reflection of reality.", "published_date": "Jun 13, 2014, 04.50 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:54:15", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-readership-survey-foxes-media-industry/articleshow/36456134.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

This would ensure that 25 per cent discount is passed on to the readers,\" an official statement said, adding that the policy has come into effect from December 31 last year. Acknowledging growing prospects of e-commerce in the publications domain, the policy also promotes sale of e-books of the Division through online platforms. As per the policy, the revenue earned from sales of digital books would be shared in the ratio of 70:30, between the Publications Division and e-commerce platform respectively. While a performance review of e-commerce platforms would also be done after two years for any further action, it has also rationalised the pricing mechanism of key journals and magazines based on a formula, incorporating production costs and discounts. \"The policy framework focuses on participation of critical stakeholders like agents, distributors and institutions making bulk purchase through discount slabs, credit and exchange facility. \"It provides different discount slabs for books, journals and employment news based on the monetary limit of the order and the number of copies respectively,\" the statement said. National-level book publishing organisations like National Book Trust interested in selling the publications of the Division would be covered under the agent's discount rate of 45 percent, it said. The policy will allow credit facility to agents proportionate to their earnest money deposit with sixty days of credit which could be enhanced against suitable fixed deposit. \"The exchange facility to agents would be allowed within 60 days of billing up to 10 per cent of the gross value of the publications purchased in a year. \"However, this facility would be provided only two times in a calendar year and the exchange would not be applicable for the annual reference book India/Bharat,\" it said.", "published_date": "Jan 22, 2016, 07.23 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:54:15", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/centre-promotes-online-readership-as-part-of-new-policy/articleshow/50686739.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

BSNL Director - Finance, S K Gupta has shot off a letter to all Chief General Managers of telecom circles, flagging the \"fiercest ever competition\" being faced by the telecom sector and said \"predatory tariff offerings by the competitors\" has triggered a sharp decline in revenue from services.  \"The BSNL management is making all out efforts to ease the pressure on liquidity. It is expected that in near future, the liquidity position of the company will start improving,\" Gupta said in the letter dated May 16.  He asserted that normalcy in liquidity position is expected to be restored by the next quarter.  BSNL has been able to sustain its customer base, despite the persistent pressure of competition on its revenue.  \"The telecom sector being capital intensive, wherein even to remain in business 'or' to ensure business sustainability, the service providers are required to invest in newer technologies at frequent intervals, as technologies evolve at very fast pace,\" the letter said.  The cumulative effect of these factors have resulted in liquidity crunch, Gupta added.  The letter assumes significance as distressed telecom PSUs Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) are saddled with massive debt and have faced problems in clearing staff salaries in the recent past.  The government is in the process of working out a rescue plan for MTNL and BSNL in form of a revival package that entails components like Voluntary Retirement Scheme, asset monetisation, and allocation of 4G spectrum.  Overall, the telecom sector has been battered by falling tariffs, eroding profitability, and towering debt, in the face of stiff competition triggered by disruptive offerings of Reliance Jio , owned by richest Indian Mukesh Ambani.  The relentless tariff war that ensued after Jio's entry into the telecom sector with free voice calls and SMS, bundled with cheap data has led to pressure on margins of even private operators that have scrambled to match the competition.

The momentum is expected to continue and the industry will grow at a 13% CAGR to $136 billion by 2021, according to the report titled \u2018How Does India Travel\u2019. The report outlines how India spends on travel, the influence of online channels in their purchase journey and potential growth opportunities for travel businesses till 2021.  The report cites a 12% growth in transportation ($50 billion), 13% growth in lodging ($21 billion) and consumption, which includes spends on shopping, recreation and food, to grow at 13% ($65 billion) over the next three years.  Additionally, as more people come online, smartphone penetration improves and use of digital payments goes up, the report estimates that Indian travellers will spend an additional $24 billion on online travel bookings over the next three years, a growth from 25% in 2018 to 35% in 2021.  Vikas Agnihotri, country director, sales, Google India said: \u201cNew users perceive that online channels are geared towards the more frequent flyers and experience-oriented travellers; and existing travellers research online but the lack of trust in payments and booking experience make them end up booking offline.  If travel players tap these online users through personalised marketing, messaging and travel plans, they can further augment online travel bookings. This can be done by adopting digital technologies to influence customers early in the journey and moving from one-time engagement to ongoing relationships to have a positive impact.\u201d  Arpan Sheth, partner Bain & Company added: \u201cThere is a perception amongst consumers that online channels are geared towards premium customers, along with a marked distrust around payment and pricing terms. It is imperative for businesses to address these concerns in order to effectively tap into the growing base of users.\u201d  The report states that during key research-heavy phase of interest, research and experience, digital plays a pivotal role with over 86% of consumers being influenced by online channels. During this phase, travellers spend their maximum time on search, travel tour provider websites, price comparison websites, and travel articles. Online video too plays a significant role with 21% of travellers being influenced by this platform. In the booking and sharing phase, the report states that nearly 60% of customers book transport and lodging online, and over 50% share feedback online with social media being the dominant platform.  The report further identified the five cohorts of travellers in India, across business and leisure travel, and categorised each against their online research behaviour:  Frequent flyers: Nearly 70% of them booked online, cumulatively spent $17 billion in 2018. They make their choices based on convenience, availability, brand preference and past experience. Budget business traveller: 86% of them researched online whereas only 60% book online, cumulatively spent $20 billion in 2018. This cohort makes their decisions based on cost of travel, availability and consultation amongst their personal business network.  Experience-oriented traveller: Around 70% of their bookings were done online. and cumulatively spent $22 billion in 2018.  They extensively research both online and offline for \u2018authentic\u2019 experiences and convenience of options; display high loyalty towards preferred brand of airlines or hotels and actively share experiences.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Indians spent Rs 6.5 lakh crore on travel in 2018</h1>", "description": "With an increasing disposable income, Indians took more than 182 crore domestic and international trips in 2018, spending upwards of $94 billion ( Rs 6.5 lakh crore), which is equivalent to about 3.5% of gross domestic product.  Expenditure of Indian travellers grew at a compounded rate of 9.3% over the last three years and could grow up to $136 billion (Rs 9.5 lakh crore) by 2021, according to a joint report by Google and management consulting firm Bain and Company.  Domestic trips accounted for the majority of the travel at close to 180 crore domestic trips last year and an expenditure of roughly $72 billion. Meanwhile, 2.6 crore international trips were undertaken by Indians during the year, running up a bill of $22 billion.  Indians spent close to 11% of their average disposable income on travel and tourism, which is comparable to developed economies such as the US, UK, Japan, and Australia, the report stated. Airways is fast gaining popularity with Indian travellers.  Expenditure on air travel grew at a compounded rate of 24% over the past three years. More than half of the $36 billion spent by Indians on transport in 2018 was on airfare as they increasingly preferred planes over trains for long distance journeys, said the report. However, cost-effective transportation by railways still remained dominant, with close to half the trips in India being on railways.  India has about 39 crore active internet users, and it hardly comes as a surprise that about $23.5 billion, or 25% of the expenditure on travel, was spent online. The penetration of online booking is high for air and rail travel, at more than 50%, while for lodging it remains moderate at 26%, as per the Google and Bain report.  While the report predicts the expenditure on travel by Indians to grow to $136 billion in the next three years, online bookings could grow by $24 billion during the same period, it said. That throws up immense opportunity for online travel aggregators.  The tourism industry, which includes local tourism as well as inbound tourism from other countries, is one of the major generators of employment. It accounted for 9.4% of India\u2019s GDP in 2018.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">India Inc high-fliers splurging on bespoke vacations</h1>", "description": "KOLKATA | NEW DELHI: Cookiecutter itineraries are so yesterday \u2014 for India Inc\u2019s high-fliers, holidays are all about the path less trodden.  Promoters, CXOs and senior professionals are splurging on experiential luxury trips \u2014 from igloo stays for an Aurora Borealis experience to private yachting on the Mediterranean, and leopard sightings at private concessions in Africa to glacier and volcano helicopter trips in Iceland \u2014 which could end up costing from Rs 1.85 lakh to Rs 4 lakh per person per day.  Recently, a promoter-CEO holidaying with his family in Ibiza, a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea, was very specific \u2014 he wanted to rent a black yacht. The travel planners searched high and low, only to find that black yachts were notoriously hard to maintain, and thus few and far between. Finally, they zeroed in on one belonging to Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo. It cost \u20ac27,000 (Rs 21 lakh) for six hours, nearly thrice the rent for a white yacht. Clubbed with private plane rides and top-end hotels, the eightday trip cost the six-member family nearly Rs 78 lakh.  Another promoter, with an interest in painting, requested for art historians who could take him through the Louvre during a recent holiday to Paris. Classical art one day, contemporary paintings on another, meeting with art critics on the third \u2014 just having these experts on board cost about Rs 1 lakh a day.  \u201cThere has been a huge increase in high-end evolved travellers looking for more experiential holidays. It\u2019s no longer just about going where no one has gone before; it\u2019s about doing things no one has ever done before,\u201d says Abraham Alapatt, president (marketing), Thomas Cook India.  Well-travelled, well-heeled professionals want access to places and one-of-a-kind experiences, for which they are shelling out steep premiums. \u201cIndian travellers are becoming more mature and discerning,\u201d says Amit Kalsi, CEO of boutique travel design company Experiential Travel Journeys. One of Kalsi\u2019s clients is keen on viewing the solar eclipse from a Chile valley \u2014 the cost of a five-day trip for a couple comes to Rs 60 lakh.   EXCLUSIVE EXPERIENCES  \u201cIt\u2019s no more about bling, but more about experiences that are exclusive and personally emotional. Then money isn\u2019t a barrier,\u201d says Sanjar Imam, founder-director of Panacheworld, which customised the Ibiza and Paris trips for the promoters.   WHAT\u2019S DRIVING THIS TREND?  The global market has seen an increase in luxury travellers from India, experts say, fuelled by a growth in numbers of high net-worth individuals. Luxury travellers can spend six times or more on trips compared with others. According to a report by Amadeus, India\u2019s luxury travel market is set to grow at an annual rate of 12.8% between 2015 and 2025. Online travel company MakeMyTrip says it is witnessing a growth of 100-200% to destinations such as Japan, South Africa, Seychelles and Maldives.  There has also been a big jump in holidays that are focused on families and kids.  Raj Khosla, managing director of MyMoney-Mantra, has watched the great migration in Kenya from a hot air balloon and trekked in the Canadian Rockies. His holidays now revolve around unusual, hard-to-reach destinations where he can spend quality time with family. \u201cI love to travel, and I\u2019m only limited by the amount of time I can spare,\u201d he says.  Bragging rights are also up for grabs.  \u201cYou may have done this trip, but have you done it like this? It\u2019s about newer experiences, being the first to experience something,\u201d says Imam of Panacheworld.  A debit-to-credit economy and professionals who increasingly want to measure wealth by the kind of experiences they\u2019ve had, are major reasons for this trend, says Alapatt of Thomas Cook.  \u201cBusiness has been growing 30% year-on-year for the past two years, and this year, we\u2019re looking at 45-55%,\u201d says Vasim Shaikh, founder of bespoke tour company The Q Experiences. This June, he is organising a luxury cruise through the Svalbard archipelago off Norway. Ticket costs could go up to Rs 15.25 lakh per person, excluding air fares. Catering on the trip will be overseen by celebrity chef Vicky Ratnani.  Karan Anand, head (relationships), Cox & Kings, says this summer they have a trip across Italy that costs Rs 30 lakh per person. Highlights include private visits to glass-making workshops and wine-tasting sessions in Tuscany.  Luxury is, after all, about intimate experiences.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Millennial travellers opt for loans to see dream destinations</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: Whether it\u2019s a trip to the Game of Thrones sets or skydiving in Pattaya, more Indian travellers are opting for travel loans to tick the boxes of their dream destinations and bucket lists.  While Thomas Cook and Cox & Kings have been offering travel loans to customers for a while, operators say the quantum of such advances has been going up steadily on the back of the growing millennial travel base and online accessibility, which has spawned digital startups.  Startups including Paytm and BigBreaks have started offering EMI facilities to customers over the past few months.  Depending on the travel agent and a customer\u2019s risk profile, the interest rate varies from 9% to 13% and in some cases even 0%, for up to 18 months.  SanKash, a Gurgaon-based startup that began offering travel loans six months ago, now generates about 100 loan requests daily.  \u201cWe have seen customers moving from domestic tours to international travel and shift vacations from Asia to Europe. They are able to enjoy the one vacation they take exactly the way they want it and further take more than one, too,\u201d said Akash Dahiya, cofounder of SanKash. \u201cWith our aggregator partnerships with entities like Travel Boutique Online and BirdRes, we reach out to 1,000 partners at a pan-India level and plan to reach 10,000 by next year.\u201d  SanKash has NBFCs Apollo Finvest and DMI Finance as its partners and a large private sector lender taking a risk on this segment, Dahiya said.  Thomas Cook, which works with SanKash besides Tata Capital and Bajaj Finance, is launching a product called Holiday Basket, which will allow middle-class Indian travellers to pick two overseas and two domestic destinations in two years, with loans sanctioned in advance for select options. Thomas Cook said the loans should help travellers insulate themselves from developments such as the recent aviation crisis and unexpected price increases.  \u201cWe have witnessed over the past few years fairly aggressive growth in terms of the number of people enquiring about travel loans. People are now used to the fact that across products and services, loans are being offered. As more young customers come into play, they are more aligned to the concept of taking loans, even for a vacation,\u201d said Abraham Alapatt, president, and group head, marketing, service quality, value added services and innovation at Thomas Cook.  Cox & Kings said the percentage of travellers opting for loans through them has gone up to about 12% from 5% over the past two to three years.  \u201cThere are reasons for it. One, easy availability of credit and second is the understanding that taking a loan for a holiday is no longer frowned upon. There is no specific destination or tour package. It all boils down to affordability. Ideally, travel loans are taken by people when the ticket size of the holiday is over Rs 50,000 per person,\u201d said Karan Anand, head of relationships.  According to Anand, earlier, it was primarily banks that offered loans for travel but now many NBFCs are also offering loans at zero per cent interest.  Digital loan platform India-Lends said personal loans for travel have grown 55% over the past year. Millennials account for 85% of loan seekers on IndiaLends , looking to borrow amounts ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh.  The company said many travel plans are the result of long weekends and last-minute holiday planning, which require quick, accessible financing options.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just those who don\u2019t have enough savings, but also those who want better travel experiences or wish to visit finer destinations who are opting for loans,\u201d said Gaurav Chopra, founder of IndiaLends.  Heena Akhtar, cofounder of TripXOXO , a digital platform for travellers to book experiences and sightseeing tours, said popular activities in the itineraries of loan-seeking customers include skydiving in Pattaya and a tour of the Game of Thrones sets in Spain, Ireland and Croatia.  On Paytm, interest rates for EMI options depend on the credit cards and could range from 13% to 17%.  \u201cIt is uncommon for people to take loans to travel but there is a gradual change in how travellers think. As more money is infused into the economy, the market has opened up new avenues for travellers,\u201d said Kapil Goswamy, MD of BigBreaks.com.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Booking.com sees opportunity in India, will invest more: CEO</h1>", "description": "Gillian Tans is the CEO of Amsterdam headquartered Booking.com , the world\u2019s largest travel ecommerce business. In an interview to Vinod Mahanta and Anumeha Chaturvedi, Tans said India is one of the fastest growing geographies \u2013 68% last year \u2014 in the company\u2019s universe. Tans, who rides a bike to work everyday, spoke about Oyo\u2019s overseas expansion and its business model, hospitality industry and the OTAs and overtaking Airbnb in homestay business. Edited excerpts:    How is Booking faring in India?  We now have 880,000 plus listings across 23 property types with growth of over 68% in 2017-18. The local players might have better local supply but we are catching up. Now we have to build our brand here. We will invest because we see a big opportunity in both outbound, inbound and local travel.   Booking has also grown from a Dutch startup into a global travel major. The Indian startup Oyo is now trying to go global \u2014 How difficult do you think it will be for them to take their business global?  It is hard work. We have learnt that you can have a very good model for India, but you need to understand if it will work in other countries. So I don\u2019t know how easy or difficult it would be for Oyo. I do have a lot of respect for Oyo because I always admire when people have big ambitions. We work very well together with Oyo and have done so since the beginning.   Any chance you might look at Oyo or any other Indian travel startup for a possible acquisition?  Oyo is on our platform just like other suppliers or hotel chains, but we don\u2019t invest in the supply side of our business.  Marriott recently announced that it will get into the homestay business. Over time, online travel aggregators (OTAs) have also become so big that they are now hurting hotel company margins. Do you see a backlash coming from hospitality companies?  Booking.com has over two million properties while Marriott together with Starwood has about 8000. It\u2019s a big difference. Hotel chains are very focused on the value they can deliver to these hotel owners, but I don\u2019t know if they can position themselves as competing directly with a company like Booking.com. We have very different types of clientele. I don\u2019t think that is coming in each other\u2019s way.   Is it true that you have overtaken Airbnb in terms of homestay listings?  I think in terms of number of properties worldwide, yes. In the US, Airbnb is still bigger than us but globally, yes. Even in India, we grew 40% in that segment. We have been focusing on this segment and we see that customers really like to have localised experiences.   How will new government regulations affect the homestay business?  We embrace regulation because it creates a level playing field. We've seen Europe, where there is no clear regulation, it makes things difficult. It's better for cities if there are clear regulations for customers because they know when something is legal or not right.   Last year, Booking.com spent nearly $4 billion on marketing, with most going to Google. Will online companies continue to depend on platforms to generate demand and build their brands?  We need to go where our customers go to look for properties. Booking learnt early on how to optimise search with Google. We do 1.5 million room nights every day. Earlier Booking had a formula and that was based on making data driven decisions. But measuring brand advertising in TV was difficult. So we literally had a strike in the company with people saying if we can't click on it, we can't advertise on it. But now we are on TV around the world. In markets like US, people didn't know us so we had to go on TV. Now we are doing more and more with platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which a lot of our customers use. For us local partnerships like airlines, banks etc are also important.

The physical shortage has also made the European currency rather expensive.  \u201cEuro is in great shortage in India ,\u201d said Ravi Menon, head of foreign exchange, India, Cox & Kings. During the peak season, banks are not selling Euros to all the money changers due to lower import of the currency notes, he added.  According to Cox & Kings, about five lakh Indians travel to Europe between April and July \u2013 the peak summer holiday season at home. They include leisure travellers, those visiting friends and family, and others availing of incentives to make that trip overseas.  \u201cEuro 500 notes have been discontinued by European banks. That has led to a demand-supply mismatch in the market,\u201d said Gagan Malhotra, head of Travel Money, the foreign exchange brand of FCM Travel Solutions.  The European Central Bank (ECB) stopped issuing 500 denomination notes because of concerns it could facilitate illegal activities. Even though the announcement was made in 2016, most countries terminated issuance of the note in January. Germany and Austria had an additional three months as their deadline was April 26.  Menon said that if Indian banks could import more currency notes, the supply could percolate down to exchange houses and travellers. However, banks are unwilling to do so because of KYC compliance. Banks prefer that the rolling of cash is reduced.  The number of Indians travelling to Europe has also seen a growth of around 15% due to the ICC World Cup in the UK and growing popularity of Europe as a destination, said Daniel D\u2019souza, president and country head, leisure, SOTC Travel.  As a result, most travel firms are encouraging travellers to use pre-paid cards.  Kapil Goswamy, MD of BigBreaks.com, said the problem of a demand-supply mismatch for Euros is manifest due to the tourist season rush. \u201cThere is strong demand for the Euro currency at this time of the year,\u201d he said.

The association is making a written representation to the government on the matter and thinks this will severely cripple the sector further post demonetisation.  With effect from the January 22, the government expects tour operators to pay 60% service tax on 60% of the invoice value. Currently, tour operators pay 10% on the invoice value for booking hotels and for other tours the tax is payable on 30% of the bill. The new service tax rule is being seen as a precursor to GST .  Subhash Goyal, chairman of the aviation and tourism committee of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is of the opinion that the tax will further encourage online portals which are either foreign funded or foreign based as they will not have to pay any service tax and there won\u2019t be a level playing field.  \u201cWe can\u2019t export taxes as per the international norms. For instance, It\u2019s not in the purview to charge taxes on services which are provided abroad like trips organized for countries in Europe and South East Asia. If the GST also comes at a high rate the industry would be finished,\u201d said Goyal.  With demonetization hitting the industry sector experts were expecting a breather in the form of lower taxes. \u201cRecovery is fragile. It would have been helpful to keep the environment static till it fully recovers. We will consider anything that our industry peers consider appropriate.

Travellers can enjoy all the facilities available in Bangkok and Pattaya in these countries, but without the nuisance encountered in Thailand. Moreover, the clubs and hotels are cheap in comparison to Thailand as these countries are trying to improve their tourism infrastructure. Being closer to Europe also give them another draw. Plus, distance also gives them advantage. For instance, a flight to Tashkent from Delhi takes just three hours.  Apart from that, the tour cost to Central Asia is also not much higher than a trip to Thailand. According to operators, a four-day trip to Bangkok costs nearly about Rs 50,000 per passenger, while a trip to these Central Asian country will cost about Rs 60,000.  Corporate houses send their employees to incentive tours in which they are treated to night life, freedom, dance, and entertainment.

The Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), the apex body for tour operators and standalone travel agents and tour operators said business has been static year on year for tour operators catering to overseas tourists this year on account of GST and the lack of input credit, safety perceptions concerning India, the rise in e visa fee in July, state centric regulations and other factors. Standalone tour operators and travel agents that ET spoke to said business has declined or stayed static compared to last year.  \u201cBusiness for our operators has been static year on year and GST is the main factor. There is no input tax credit available for tour operators. There are also other factors like the seat capacity factor and expensive air seats. Flights from UK to Thailand are cheaper than UK to India and we are not competitive with international markets. We need to control these areas that are cost prohibitive. We are discussing all these matters with the ministry of tourism,\u201d said Pronob Sarkar, president, IATO.  Rajeev Kohli, joint managing director of Creative Travel, which specialises in inbound travel said legacy business for traditional source markets is down for his company. \u201cWe have ventured into new markets and that business has grown but our legacy business is down for the traditional source markets. Tour operators are not allowed to take input credit on the 5% GST tax while we are paying tax on hotels, transport etc. The end supplier should be allowed to take credit for the GST paid. This is not a viable proposition,\u201d he added.  The CAPA India Inbound Tourism report released this week stated that while total foreign visitor arrivals increased by 15.9% year on year in 2017, if visitors from Bangladesh were excluded (the vast majority of whom do not come from leisure) the growth was only 8%. India lost market share in five of the 10 source markets over the past three years particularly in the UK, France and Sri Lanka as per the report. CAPA estimates that only 2.4-2.6% million people visit India each year for the purpose of a holiday which is far less compared to a city state like Singapore or the island destination Bali or Thailand at 31 million.  R Parthiban, director at Delhi headquartered Swagatam Tours which has offices in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru said business for his company which caters to visitors from markets like the US and UK has been static because of many factors. \u201cThe government takes one step forward and two steps backwards. Without any intimation to the tour operators they have increased the visa fee to $ 80 from $ 50 in July this year. This is becoming a burden. The structured tourism promotions are not there,\u201d he said.  \u201cFrom January onwards they have closed down 7-8 tourism offices. For the entire Europe, they have one office in Germany. They have said there will be more aggressive promotions and agencies involved. But, they should ensure other steps are ready before closing the existing channels,\u201d he added.  Akshay Kumar, CEO of Mercury Himalayan Explorations, which specialises in adventure travel for tourists in markets like the UK said business from markets like Australia has registered a dip while the UK market has been muted. \u201cThe multiplicity of taxes within tourism for transport, hotels and restaurants is complicated. The smaller operators are feeling the hit as they are finding it difficult to comply under the regime. There have also been state centric bans and regulations around adventure travel.\u201d  ", "published_date": "Sep 14, 2018, 08.07 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:03", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/travel/tour-operators-say-gst-issues-costly-visa-hitting-overseas-tourist-business/articleshow/65802935.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">TRAI mulls regulating apps streaming TV channels</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The telecom watchdog is considering regulation of over-the-top (OTT) apps that stream TV channels , such as Hotstar , Airtel TV and Sony Liv , to bring them under a licensing framework similar to the one for broadcasters.  Trai, which recently introduced new tariff rules aimed at making television viewing more affordable, now plans to focus on carriage of TV channels via apps that are currently unregulated and, in some cases, offered free.  \u201cCarriage of TV programming has been licensed out to registered broadcasters who are then allowed to give the content to cable operators or satellite players, under a licensing framework. If a third party, like an app, is showing the same channels without paying carriage charges and licence fee, it creates disparity,\u201d said a senior official who did not want to be identified.  \u201cEither both should be under the ambit of the licence, or both should be exempted,\u201d the official added. Trai may issue a consultation paper on the matter by July-August.     In India, a broadcasting licence is valid for 10 years, and the licensee must comply with the programming and advertising code under the cable TV (regulation) Act. The channels must adhere to guidelines set by the I&B ministry.  In contrast, apps are governed by the IT Act, but are not licensed.  Besides facing resistance from apps that stream TV channels, Trai\u2019s move is also expected to be opposed by broadcasters that have their own streaming apps such as Star India, Sony, Zee and Times Network.  Video streaming service MX Player\u2019s CEO Karan Bedi said, \u201cOTT platforms are only an additional medium for viewers to watch TV channels. TV channels by themselves are already sufficiently regulated. Any additional licensing framework is entirely unnecessary.\u201d   \u2018Bid to Pre-empt Any Legal Cases\u2019  MX Player is owned by Times Internet, part of The Times Group, which publishes The Economic Times.  Broadcasters having their own streaming apps have already told the regulator \u2014 on a separate consultation paper pertaining to regulation of OTT players in the telecom space \u2014 that apps should not be regulated, and have sought forbearance from Trai.  Star India, in its submission on the communication OTT paper, had said, \u201cTrai does not have the authority under the Act (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997) to regulate OTTs\u2026 the internet ecosystem, of which OTTs are an integral part, is governed and regulated by the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules notified thereunder.\u201d  \u201cIn addition, all internet companies are subject to the extant law of the land such as the Competition Act, Consumer Protection Act, intellectual property laws, to name a few. These legislative frameworks set the commercial and technical parameters and the legal boundaries for OTTs to conduct business in a market-based environment,\u201d Star India added.  However, DTH companies and cable operators\u2019 associations have asked the regulator to address the non-level playing field created by these OTT apps providing linear transmission of satellite TV channels of various broadcasters \u2014 or, in other words, showing the same show on TV and an app at the same time \u2014 which they feel is a violation of licence rules.  Trai is separately carrying out a consultation process on whether to regulate apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Skype, which provide communication services like voices calls and messages similar to mobile phone companies but are not regulated, unlike the telcos.  Carriers in India have long been demanding that these communication OTT players be also regulated under the principle of \u2018same-service, same-rules\u2019. However, OTTs argue that a regulatory regime for them would stifle innovation.  But while recommendations on this issue are awaited, another official said Trai wants to set the ball rolling for regulatory clarity on OTT apps in the broadcasting sector, as it feels the impact will be limited to fewer consumers and companies vis-\u00e0-vis communication OTT apps that are now being used by a far higher number of people.  \u201cViewing TV shows on apps is still an urban phenomenon and yet to reach the mass scale that OTT apps in communication have,\u201d the person said, adding that the regulator does not want to be caught off-guard like in the case of OTT communication apps where the consultation has been hanging fire for many years. The person added that Trai\u2019s move is also \u201cto pre-empt any legal cases it might get caught in due to the non-level playing field\u201d.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had in April issued a consultation paper to deliberate whether there is a need to fix entry level net worth requirement for multi-system operators (MSOs) in cable TV services.  \u201cThe financial strength will outrightly give the regulator/information and broadcasting ministry an insight into the seriousness and sustainability of an MSO and also its strength to comply with\u2026regulations framed by Trai,\u201d All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF) has said.  It is of the view that eligibility of minimum net worth will not only put a check on the violation of rules by MSOs but also ascertain the sustainability and growth of MSOs and cable sector.  Under the present rules prescribed for getting a licence for operating as an MSO, any individual or company can do so by paying a processing fee of Rs 1 lakh, which does not present a filter for serious and non-serious players, the federation said.  Apart from AIDCF, some of its members including DEN Networks , Hathway Digital, GTPL Hathway, IndusInd Media and Communications, and Siti Networks have also favoured an entry level net worth for the players.  The I&B ministry has granted 1,471 MSO licences, out of which 1,143 MSOs were operational as of the end of last year.  Hathway has submitted that the absence of financial checks is one of the reasons for the non-orderly growth of the sector.  Those supporting the minimum net worth requirement also pointed out that MSOs have to make investments including head ends, conditional access , subscriber management system, and set-top-boxes.  As for other TV service providers, there is no minimum entry level net worth requirement for direct-to-home (DTH) companies, but there is an entry fee of Rs 10 crore. For Headend in the Sky (HITS) platforms, there\u2019s aRs 10 crore net worth requirement.  For TV channels, there is a minimum net worth requirement of Rs 20 crore for a news channel (plus Rs 5 crore for every additional channel) and Rs 5 crore in case of nonnews channel (Rs 2.5 crore for every additional channel).

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">OVL slapped with Rs 7,666-crore service tax demand</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The tax department has slapped ONGC Videsh Ltd a service tax demand of Rs 7,666.10 crore on remittance the firm makes to its overseas subsidiaries for past one decade, sources in know of the development said.  OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has stakes in 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand. For the operations of these projects, the local units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL , which would transmit the funds.  The service tax department now contends that the overseas units are rendering a service to OVL and as such the company is liable to pay service tax at the full rate, sources said.  The tax demand pertains to the period 2006 to 2017.  The service tax department had first issued a demand cum show-cause notice on October 11, 2011, requiring OVL to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 2,816.31 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered.  The tax amount was calculated based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the company's financial statements covering the period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010.  Sources said the tax department contends that these expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by the foreign branches and operator of the joint venture/ consortium to OVL.  Subsequently, five more demand-cum-show cause notices have been issued based on similar contentions covering the period up to March 31, 2015, to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 3,286.36 crore (including Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the company.  A demand-cum-show cause notice has been issued based on similar contentions covering the period April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 1,563.32 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from OVL.  Sources said OVL believes that no service tax is due or payable and is contesting the demand.  According to OVL, investments made overseas through subsidiaries or branches or joint ventures do not constitute availing of any service. The company operates the projects at an internal rate of return on investments of 12-13 per cent and if it has to pay 14-15 per cent service tax on such investments, the projects will give negative returns and would become infructuous.  Also, it contends that service tax by law can be levied on services rendered within the country. And even if one were to assume that its branches or subsidiaries were rendering any service, they were all overseas and not within India and so cannot be subject to any service tax, sources said.  Sources said OVL management is of the view that the disputed service-tax demands are not tenable in law.  OVL had reported a net profit of Rs 981.5 crore in 2017-18 fiscal on a turnover of Rs 12,945.6 crore. It produced 9,353 million tonnes of oil in the fiscal, up from 8.434 million tonnes in the previous year. Gas output increased to 4.811 billion cubic meters in 2017-18 from 4.369 BCM in the previous year.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">3 months into new tariffs, TRAI looks to lower TV bills</h1>", "description": "New Delhi: India\u2019s telecom and broadcasting regulator is considering issuing a consultation paper aimed at reducing monthly cable and DTH bills of consumers, an official said, while admitting that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India\u2019s ( Trai ) new pricing regime which had aimed to make TV viewing more affordable hasn\u2019t worked as planned.  \u201cA consultation paper is in the works on reducing the broadcasting tariffs,\u201d a Trai official said, asking not to be named. \u201cWe will have to see what kind of mechanism can be adopted to do so,\u201d he added, without giving specific details on possible ways in which the tariffs could be cut.  Historically, while broadcasters like Star India have maintained that Trai does not have the jurisdiction to look into tariffs, the official said that the regulator always had the right but chose to maintain forbearance and let market forces decide the tariffs, a formula it also used for the telecom sector .  Trai\u2019s latest move will come after it changed the tariff regime with the aim of making pricing of TV channels transparent.   Complaints of Costs Going up  This should also have reduced the cost of TV viewing for consumers. But the new regime has in fact led to several complaints that rates have actually gone up, with all round confusion on implementation as well.  The Trai official conceded that regulator\u2019s move did not play out the way the authority had earlier expected. \u201cThe aim was to make TV channel pricing more transparent and to give control of channels to the consumers, while making it more affordable\u2026 but it did not pan out that way,\u201d the official said.  Last December, Trai mandated that customers must pay for only those channels that they choose to see, leading to all channels getting priced individually. The rules came into effect from February 1, this year.  Now, channels cannot be priced more than Rs 19, if part of a bouquet of channels. There is no pricing cap on channels which are not part of any bouquet and are designated premium channels. Also, there is no cap on the amount of discount a broadcaster can offer on the sum of the MRPs of all the channels in the pack.  But while the move lowered tariffs for some consumers \u2014 for instance restaurants that show only one channel like a sports channel \u2014 for many others, monthly tariffs went up. A Crisil report has said that the new tariff regime would increase bill amounts of most cable TV and DTH subscribers, several examples of which also surfaced in the following months along with complaints.  \u201cOur analysis of the impact of the regulations indicates a varied impact on monthly TV bills . Based on current pricing, the monthly TV bill can go up by 25% from Rs 230-240 to ~Rs 300 per month for viewers who opt for the top 10 channels, but will come down for those who opt up to top 5 channels,\u201d said Sachin Gupta, senior director at the ratings firm.  Trai, at that time, had rubbished the report, and said that cost of TV viewing will fall over time.  Floating a consultation paper on reducing tariffs will be possible legally as well, since the Supreme Court has already said that Trai has the power and jurisdiction over framing tariffs and regulations for the broadcasting sector, the official pointed out. The court gave this observation while hearing Trai\u2019s special leave petition on the 15% discount cap on TV channel bouquets with regards to the tariff order regulations.", "published_date": "May 22, 2019, 07.30 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:07", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/3-months-into-new-tariffs-trai-looks-to-lower-tv-bills/articleshow/69420499.cms", "source": "ecospd"},
{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Top banks under taxman\u2019s lens over service tax issue</h1>", "description": "NEW DELHI: The intelligence arm of the indirect tax department has asked three top banks to pay full tax due on fees paid to card and payment companies based outside India from as far back as six years ago.  The Director General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued notices to State Bank of India , ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank for \u201cshort payment of service tax\u201d on the money they paid to multinationals such as MasterCard , Visa and American Express .  At the heart of the matter is the lack of clarity on the tax liability on the annual fees that banks pay multinationals. Banks typically deduct tax at source on such payments \u2014 an amount that\u2019s reimbursed to them \u2014 and also pay service tax.  The intelligence arm\u2019s investigations show that banks deduct about 10% at source on such payments to multinationals. However, the authorities said the banks are liable to pay tax on the gross figure \u2014 the fees and the amount deducted at source.  \u201c\u2026(it\u2019s learnt that) your bank had short paid service tax on account of non-grossing up of TDS (tax deducted at source) in association/settlement charges made by them to their overseas service providers in respect of credit card, debit card, charge card or other payment card-related services received by them in India,\u201d reads the notice issued to a bank. ET has reviewed the notice, which demands tax since 2012-13 from the bank.  The three banks did not respond to ET\u2019s queries seeking comment on the notices. More banks could be issued notices soon, said people aware of the matter.  \u201cWhile notices have been issued to three banks now, more notices will be issued in the coming weeks,\u201d a banking official told ET. Tax experts pointed out that in many situations, the tax deducted at source is reimbursed to the banks, which they claim is not income.  \u201cWhenever Indian companies are required to deduct TDS under income tax, service tax liability is required to be paid on the grossed up amount. However, many companies have independent commercial arrangements where such TDS is reimbursed to Indian companies by the foreign service-providers. In such cases, Indian companies are reluctant to pay service tax under reverse charge as they don\u2019t consider this as part of their expense,\u201d said Sumit Lunker, a partner at PwC India. Some experts questioned the relevance of raising this demand under the goods and service tax regime, which was introduced in July 2017 and subsumed levies such as service tax.  \u201cThe approach of the service tax authorities in raking up past service tax issues, leading to service tax demands in the GST era, is posing significant challenges for all businesses. There should be a sunset clause mandating a time limit to investigate and issue notices in respect of service tax matters as the focus of business has now moved to GST,\u201d said MS Mani, a partner at Deloitte India.  Tax experts also said that in most cases, the multinationals claim they do not have a permanent establishment in India and are hence not taxable.  Permanent establishment is a concept that determines the jurisdiction for companies to pay tax.  This is the second major investigation by the DGGI. ET reported in March last year that DGGI was examining whether contracts between banks and their service providers were disguised or fraudulent.  The indirect tax department has also issued notices to banks seeking to levy GST on services such as issuing cheque books and additional credit cards, ATM use and refunds of fuel surcharge.

The company will also build a resort in Koyna over the next two years.  \u201cSo far, we operated largely in the generic holiday segment. This acquisition marks our aim to expand the holiday offerings to members in specific focus area such as adventure tourism,\u201d Ramesh Ramanathan, MD, Sterling Holidays, told ET. Sterling Holidays had not appointed any transaction advisor for the deal.  Post the acquisition, Nature Trails will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling Holidays and the \u201cNature Trails\u201d brand will be retained. Chinmay Divekar, son of Hari Divekar, will continue to head the company as chief operations officer working closely with Sterling Holidays to grow the brand.  Ramanathan said the acquisition will be funded through internal accruals and is expected to be completed before March next. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have plans to sell the inventory at Nature Trails to our members now, in future we will work out a way to do it,\u201d he said, adding that the acquisition strengthens Sterling's presence in the western part of the country. The acquisition will add to Sterling Holidays\u2019 profitability starting next fiscal (2016-17), he said.  Nature Trails currently sells adventure holidays to FIT (Free Individual Travellers), corporates and schools. \u201cWe have invested close to Rs 12 crore (excluding land cost) in building the four resorts and with our partnership with Sterling Holidays, we plan to take adventure activities right across the country,\u201d said Chinmay Divekar, director, Nature Trails Resorts Private Ltd. Divekar said the company is profitable and sells close to 45,000 room nights a year.  Over the next three years, Sterling Holidays plans to upgrade the existing facilities at Nature Trails properties. \u201cWe will invest in upgrading their existing infrastructure at the properties to push the potential and open up the offerings for MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Conference and Exhibition) as well,\u201d Ramanathan said.  Post its merger with billionaire Prem Watsa-backed Thomas Cook , Sterling Holidays has been on a revival and growth mode. In the past four years, the company has changed its focus from being a pure timeshare company to a holiday company, thereby widening its offerings to non-members as well.  Currently, the company gets up to 40% of its business at the resorts from non-members, up from 10% a few years back. Ramanathan said the company will invest about Rs 125 crore in 2015-16 to upgrade its existing resorts and start construction of its property at Wayanad, Kerala.  \u201cWe are working out acquisitions at five locations in the north and west which should be closed by March \u201916,\u201d he said. In 2017, the company plans to expand overseas in markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Dubai.  Sterling Holidays, which has a membership base of 85,000, has an inventory of 1,767 rooms spread across 24 resorts in the country. It also has 150 acres of land available in 15 additional sites where it plans to add new resorts in the coming years.", "published_date": "Oct 27, 2015, 05.20 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:07", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/Thomas-Cook-owned-Sterling-acquires-Nature-Trails-Resorts/articleshow/49546217.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) examined complaints against 344 advertisements, of which 74 advertisers ensured prompt corrective action, a statement said.  The consumer complaints council (CCC) of the ASCI upheld complaints against 229 ads out of 270 evaluated by them.  Of the 229 misleading ads, a maximum 123 belonged to the healthcare sector, followed by education sector (83), food and beverages sector (7) and personal care (2). While, 14 ads were from the others category.  Over 100 ads from the healthcare sector seen in potential violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (DMR) Regulations.  Of the total 187 ads under the ASCI's suo-motu surveillance, 70 were informally resolved wherein the advertisers promptly confirmed that the ads were being withdrawn immediately.  While complaints against the remaining 117 ads were upheld, of which 79 belonged to the education sector, 30 to the healthcare sector, 4 to the food and beverages sector and 4 to the others category.  The ASCI upheld the NIIT's advertisement claim of '5,000 assured jobs' as it was misleading by exaggeration, ambiguity and implication and since the students were given a provisional offer, an assured job could not be promised to the students.  It also noted that the claim, '50,000 students placed' was not substantiated with authentic supporting data such as detailed list of students who have been placed through their institute in the banking sector, contact details of students for verification, enrolment forms and appointment letters received by the students, nor any independent audit or verification certificate.  The regulator pulled up Amul's Guajarati ad of 'only Amul ghee means a promise of purity' and 'only Amul Ghee is 100 per cent pure, is a promise of 36 lakhs farmers', as misleading by implication and stating that only Amul is 100 per cent pure and implying that other ghee brands are not, were not substantiated with comparative data of the advertiser's product and other ghee products.  It found Colgate's TV and YouTube advertisements claim misleading and found the visual representation of numerical equivalence of calcium in both milk and the toothpaste and the comparison of action of it with that of milk was considered to be incorrect.  The ASCI also pulled up the advertiser contravening the ASCI guidelines for disclaimers in advertising and said the claim was considered to be misleading by omission and implication as it distorts facts, exploits consumers' lack of knowledge and is likely to lead to grave or widespread disappointment.  It upheld complaints against Tata Motors dvertisement claim, 'Tata Nexon India's safest car. Going swift is not safe for your family' as it was not factual and was not substantiated, and there is likelihood of the consumer being misled as a result of comparison.  \"The reference made to 'Swift' in the caption, 'Going swift is not safe for your family', when seen in conjunction with the picture of Maruti Swift car, unfairly denigrated another vehicle in the four wheeler category directly. The claim is misleading by exaggeration and implication,\" it noted.  Similarly, it pulled up Maruti Suzuki's ad 'enjoy the month of March with exciting offers from Maruti Suzuki', and 'bigger savings' showing images of various models of Maruti Suzuki with their prices, were not substantiated with any supporting verifiable data.  It also observed that the disclaimer stating that the offer was on select car models was not substantiated with a detailed list of the models on which discount was available and evidence of customers who had availed the said offer was not provided and found that the claim offer was misleading by exaggeration and also contravened ASCI guidelines for disclaimers in advertising.  The ASCI also found Vodafone 's Supernet 4G ad claim, 'adding a tower every hour in crowded places' as misleading by exaggeration as it was not substantiated with any verifiable data of the hourly roll-out of the towers/sites in crowded places, or through an independent third party validation.

Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj conveyed these views to her counterpart Javad Zarif, who is visiting the country at his own initiative to brief the Indian side on his nation\u2019s approach to recent developments in the region, including on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also known as the Iran nuclear deal) and to review bilateral cooperation, sources told ET.  Iran has been consulting with other countries in the region including Russia, China , Turkmenistan and Iraq over the past few days. The visit offered India an opportunity to strike a balance in its ties with Iran and the US, which has imposed sanctions on Iran.  During his meeting with Swaraj, Zarif recalled the steps announced by President Hassan Rouhani on May 8, including decisions linked to the export of enriched material and heavy water. He said a 60-day timeline has been given to EU-3 and other parties to JCPOA to restore oil trade and banking channels.  India reiterated its position on JCPOA, the sources said, adding that it would like all parties to the agreement to continue to fulfil their commitments and engage constructively to resolve all issues peacefully and through dialogue.  On the purchase of oil from Iran, Swaraj reiterated the position that a decision would be taken after the elections, keeping in mind India\u2019s commercial considerations, energy security and economic interests, sources said.  Both sides expressed satisfaction at the operationalisation of the interim contract on Chabahar Port between India Ports Global Ltd. and Ports and Maritime Organization. The two countries shared their views on Afghanistan and agreed to maintain close coordination on the evolving situation there.  After his arrival on Monday night, Zarif said he had travelled to India to discuss the \u201cmost recent developments in the region as well as our bilateral relations\u201d with Swaraj.  \u201cIndia is one of our most important partners \u2013 economic, political and regional,\u201d Zarif pointed out.  Referring to oil trade through the rupee mechanism, which was used for purchases during sanctions before 2015, Zarif stated, \u201cA special financial system between us and Delhi has already been designed and that system has been used and is being used for bilateral cooperation.\u201d  The US reimposed strict sanctions on Iran and vowed to reduce the country\u2019s oil exports to zero after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers a year ago.  India and China, Iran\u2019s top oil clients, stopped purchases after the US withdrew waivers earlier this month to the two countries and six other nations that allowed them to import some Iranian crude without being exposed to punitive action.

Three people close to the situation said the Prem Watsa-controlled Thomas Cook is in advanced talks to buy Sterling at a 36% premium to the firm's market price. Thomas Cook is likely to pay Rs 125 per share, 36% premium to Sterling's price of Rs 98 a share, valuing the firm at Rs 852 crore. Sterling managing director Ramesh Ramanathan and Thomas Cook MD Madhavan Menon did not answer specific questions on the subject. Bay Capital, which bought 13.67% in Sterling in 2009, is expected to review Thomas Cook's final proposal by the end of this week, the three investment bankers said. Sterling shares rose 0.83% at Rs 91.5 Monday with a market capitalisation of Rs 624 crore against rival and market leader Mahindra Holidays' Rs 2,000-crore market value. Sterling shares have risen 33% in the past three months. Watsa, who bought Thomas Cook in 2012, is a well-known value investor with a disciplined approach and a habit of buying companies cheap and turning them around. DEAL WILL HELP STERLING: ANALYSTS \"To find value investment, you must focus on price,\" Watsa said in an interview to ET last month. Sterling's attempt at creating a string of holiday resorts on the lines of Club Mahindra did not get off to a good start and the firm plunged into losses in 2008-09. The turnaround started with Bay's $13.9-million investment in 2009 and Sterling's chairman and managing director R Subramanian relinquishing control. The deal was helped by the fact that Bay Capital's chief executive Siddharth Metha and Subramanian's son were schoolmates.  Bay brought in former Mahindra Holidays MD Ramesh Ramanathan to steer the company out of troubled times. Ramanathan bought fresh lease of life into operations through a series of customercentric measures. The company sold some of its non-core assets to software companies and settled its dues. \"Ramanathan brought expats to boost service capabilities. Lots of old customers are now back,\" said a travel industry executive. Overall room nights for the company have increased from 158,000 in 2010-11 to 201,000 in 2012-13. Average occupancy was up from 19% to 43% in the same period. The company posted its first quarterly net profit of Rs 62 lakh in June last year due to improved occupancy levels at its resorts. While main promoter Bay owns 13.67%, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakrishna Damani own 3.67% and 6.47%, respectively. Amit Goela, ex-CEO of Alchemy, owns around 2.35%. Ramanathan owns 2.86%. Sterling is yet to catch up with the leader, Mahindra Holidays. While Mahindra has a total membership base of 170,000, Sterling has only 67,000 members. Analysts feel that a deal with Thomas Cook will help Sterling in properly channelising the traffic of customers. \"For a travel services company to start providing hotel stay would be a vertical integration move \u2013 and they could benefit by channelisng the traffic of customers it helps to plan holidays,\" says Naimish Dave, Partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, a management consulting firm. \"The two businesses are quite different, as one is an asset-light model and the other is an asset-heavy one. Further, the aspect of utilisation of rooms will now become the primary concern.\" His comments are not specific to the story.

Once the deal is completed, the Aditya Birla Group company\u2019s capacity will go up to 90.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from the current 68.3 mtpa, giving it an entry into central India and enhancing its capacity in north and south India. The plants have a combined capacity of 22.4 mtpa.  \u201cThe assets will give the company access to newer markets of MP, Uttar Pradesh East, Himachal Pradesh and coastal Andhra where it does not have a presence as of now,\u201d Ultra-Tech said in a statement. Jaiprakash Associates Executive Chairman Manoj Gaur said the deal will help UltraTech get closer to the 100 mtpa mark.   The agreement includes a 4 mtpa plant under implementation at a cost of Rs 470 crore and factories in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.  ET first reported that UltraTech was a suitor for the assets in December 2015. The deal announcement comes two days after UltraTech called off a deal with Jaiprakash Associates to buy two cement assets in Madhya Pradesh citing regulatory issues. Both parties had entered into a scheme of arrangement for the plants in December 2014.  These assets were folded back into a larger deal package that got announced on Sunday. The transaction is subject to definitive agreements and regulatory approvals.  The cement assets of the Jaypee Group, one of the most indebted conglomerates in the country, are mostly housed under the flagship listed company Jaiprakash Associates (JPA). As group holding company, JPA also owns shares in other ventures engaged in power, real estate, sports, roads and construction, some of them listed. On a consolidated basis, its debt amounts to .`60,000 crore, according to Bloomberg data.  The final structure of the deal will be dependent on the proposed amendment of the Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act (MMDRA), said people with knowledge of this. If the amendment is not in place by March end, JPA will be split into two entities.  The existing listed entity \u2014 Jaiprakash Associates \u2014 will hold the plants in the six states with a total capacity of 22.4 mtpa. The other will be a vertically demerged entity that will house the remaining cement units along with all other non-cement businesses.  The Jaypee Group promoters will then divest their entire stake \u2014 39.38% as of December 2015 \u2014 to UltraTech, which will then make a mandatory public offer to non-promoter shareholders for an additional 25%.  By selling the shares of the company, which in turn owns the assets, the transfer of mines will be easier. MMDR currently does not permit such transactions unless the assets are auctioned. However, if the amendment comes through, then the entire 22.4 million tonnes will be hived into a stepdown subsidiary of JPA and sold to UltraTech.  This is believed to be the preferred route for the transaction, according to one of the executives cited above. Under the proposed deal, UltraTech will acquire debt of about Rs 13,500 crore and pay Rs 3,000 crore in cash, which will be used to repay part of JPA\u2019s debt. \u201cCurrently, Jaiprakash Associates has (standalone) debt of Rs 31,000 crore, which will come down to about Rs 14,000 crore after the completion of the divestment of the cement division,\u201d said one of those cited above.  Standard Chartered Bank advised UltraTech on the deal. An EV of Rs 16,500 crore translates to $108 per tonne, making it a bargain for Ultra-Tech, analysts said. In December 2014, when UltraTech had agreed to buy the 4.9 mtpa plants in MP, it had agreed to pay Rs 5,400 crore, or about $160 per tonne, 48% more than the current price.  \u201cThe valuation of the deal is quite cheap. UltraTech is getting readymade and operating plants, helping it save on the time and costs involved in setting up new cement plants,\u201d said Vijay Goel, cement analyst at Karvy Research. \u201cToday, given the clearances (chiefly land), it takes over five years to set up a cement plant and the cost is pegged at $140 per tonne.\u201d  The transaction also highlights the growing trend of lenders putting pressure on debt-laden business houses to sell assets and deleverage the balance sheet. \u201cDue to rising non-performing assets in the banking sector, it is a purely buyers\u2019 market where the seller does not have much choice other than agreeing on the term sheet offered by the buyers,\u201d said an investment banker.  \u201cThis deal clearly reflects the assertiveness of Indian lenders and vulnerability of India Inc.\u201d After several failed attempts by Jaypee to sell its cement business in the last two years, the lenders prevailed upon the company to sell a lion\u2019s share of its portfolio in one shot. The company had already divested assets worth Rs 5,000 crore in three states \u2013 Gujarat, Jharkhand and Haryana \u2013 but its debt burden left it with few choices.  Late last year, Jaypee roped in ICICI Securities for a formal sale process that also saw competing bids from KKR, Dalmia Bharath and Brookfields. The process was also monitored by executives of a group of four lead lenders \u2013 ICICI Bank , State Bank of India , Axis Bank and IDBI Bank . The last date for receiving the bids was February 15.  The final call was taken last Friday, said people aware of the matter. Gaur was asked by the lenders to finalise the deal with Ultra-Tech \u2013 the highest bidder \u2013 by Saturday. After the sale, the Jaypee Group will retain a little over 8 mtpa of installed capacity, including a 2.1 mtpa plant in Bhillai that\u2019s a 74:26 joint venture with Steel Authority of India Ltd. JPA is already in negotiations with Shree Cement to divest its stake in Bhillai Cement for Rs 2,100-2,200 crore.  \u201cThe group has been aggressive in selling assets to prune its debt over the past two years... Jaiprakash Associates has already concluded sales of 8.4 mt of cement capacity for Rs 50 billion, but debt levels are estimated to be still up 18% over the past two years,\" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in an October 2015 note.  \u201cJaiprakash Power has also sold two hydro plants of 1,391MW capacity for Rs 9,300 crore and is in talks for sale of its 500 MW Bina project. However, as the 1,391 mw hydro plants contributed 59% of FY15 EBIT, the loss of EBITDA from these projects would result in debt-to-EBITDA moving up further,\" they added. From JPA\u2019s point of view, the deal does not make things exceptionally better in terms of its overall business.  Analysts point out that JPA\u2019s cement business has been generating substantial cash flow and it contributed close to 33% to standalone EBIDTA. They said that though it may reduce its debt by Rs 16,500 crore, it also deprives the company of cash flow.", "published_date": "Feb 29, 2016, 06.01 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:26", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/cement/ultratech-acquires-jaiprakash-associates-cement-plants-for-rs-16500-crore/articleshow/51175601.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The deal value was not officially disclosed but experts said the enterprise value of the business had been pegged at $330 million. Aion Capital is a joint venture between US buyout giant Apollo Global Management and ICICI Venture .  Out of the total equity of $130 million, Bhasin and Chawla are expected to bring in $20 million as their equity contribution, while the rest is being funded by Apollo and its affiliates, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter said.  The company informed BSE in an exchange filing that a share purchase agreement was executed on March 1 in respect of 100% shareholding of the company with Plutus Financials, set up by a group that includes former GE managers, along with Bhasin and Chawla.  The deal is a major transactions in which industry veterans are being backed by bulge-bracket private equity funds to acquire parts of businesses, operations or subsidiaries \u2014 a practise that buyout funds such as Apollo have been pursuing in mature markets such as the US.  Credit Suisse was the banker to the transaction.  ET was the first to report in its January 14 edition that Apollo and Aion are partnering with Bhasin and Chawla to acquire GE Capital Services.  The transaction is expected to close in the next four-eight months, subject to approval by regulators including the Reserve Bank of India. The change of control won\u2019t affect any debt, liabilities, obligations or contracts incurred or entered into by the company, GE Capital said in its exchange filing.  There was no response to phone calls and text messages to Bhasin and Chawla. GE Capital provides credit and finance for corporate and retail customers in India. Started in 1993, the company has more than 10 million corporate and consumer finance customers and a turnover of around $350 million.   The business has three key verticals \u2014 auto, healthcare (medical equipment) and corporate loans. Clients include PVR, Alcatel-Lucent and Ballarpur Industries. The business has a turnover of around $325-350 million, said sources.  \u201cThis is a continuing indication of private equity funds supporting well-recognised professionals in buying out businesses with the principal aim of leveraging their capabilities and proven track record,\" said Vimal Bhandari, Indostar Capital Finance CEO. \u201cGiven the continuing interest of global investors in the financial services space, such transactions will continue to happen.\u201d  Bhasin, former chief executive officer of backoffice firm Genpact, previously headed GE Capital in India and Asia. Chawla, like Bhasin, has been a GE veteran. He was managing director of GE India and chief executive officer at GE Commercial Finance before he went on to launch US hedge fund and private equity advisor DE Shaw's local operations in 2006.  Bhasin and Chawla had approached several buyout funds such as Blackstone, Baring Asia and Goldman Sachs along with domestic funds like India Value Fund and Kedaara Capital to back their bid, before zeroing in on Apollo. GE is also shifting out of its Indian credit card joint venture with State Bank of India and has mandated Morgan Stanley to run a formal sale process.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">The mystery of intriguing Indian spices</h1>", "description": "By Anoothi Vishal  It's that time of the year again when my mother sits down for her annual ritual of pickling. Small green mangoes are cut, their flesh smeared with salt and turmeric and spices are added: asafoetida , fenugreek seeds, fennel, kalaunji (onion seeds) and a dash of red chilli powder. These will then pickle in oil and sunlight for a few days before the achaar is ready.  This mango pickle is similar to that made by many other families in Uttar Pradesh, its taste determined by the mix of spices my mother adds through andaz sans strict measurements.  However, in these days of convenience food, it is also possible to find roughly a similar mix packaged and retailed as a generic \"achari masala\" that can be instantly added to pickles, vegetables and meats by cooks who do not understand a basic thing about Indian cooking: how spices are used in specific ways depending upon the season, the region which the recipe belongs to, and most importantly, the ingredients. When my mother pickles red chillies in the winter, her spice mix changes: rai or brown mustard seeds replace fenugreek.  Since the main ingredient -chilli - is bitter, there is an instinctive understanding that you cannot add bitter fenugreek seeds to the mix. Instead, there is amchoor powder for tartness, coriander for a whiff of sweetness, crushed cumin and rock salt to balance the flavours and provide heat suitable for the winter chill. These specific ways in which we use our spices makes Indian food tough for beginners to cook. Anyone can follow recipes and pick up packaged masalas but creating regional and seasonal flavours requires a deep understanding of how spices are combined to balance tastes.  Mango pickle and the spices within.  Like classic combinations in other cuisines - rosemary-potatoes, avocado-chilli and tomato-basil - Indian cuisines too have their own classic combinations.  This is something that is usually overlooked because as chef Manjit Gill says,\"There are recipe books but no book that teaches the principles of Indian cooking.\"Home cooks instinctively cook up traditional combinations, which are based on Ayurvedic principles even if this knowledge itself is lost. Combinations like potatoes with fenugreek seeds, green mango or okra with fennel, eggplant with onion seeds and fish with ajwain (carom) are all classic flavours of Indian cookery which every home cook instinctively knows.  If you study these at a deeper level, you realise they have come about as a result of balancing the heating-cooling doshas (ascribed to each ingredient in Ayurvedic texts) and as a result of balancing tastes (sweet, sour, salt, bitter, astringent and pungent). In the absence of this understanding, a cook may douse a preparation like eggplant (bitter) with garam masala laced with pepper (also pungent) and successfully kill it!  Art of Garam Masala Nothing has been more detrimental to Indian cooking than the overuse of garam masala in restaurants. Indiscriminately used, it has turned into a weapon of mass destruction.   Pickles at a market in Amritsar.  In reality, Indian cooking does not need garam masala at all. It is superfluous, added at best as an \"ornamentation\" to finish specific dishes. \"Spices in Indian dishes are added at different stages of cooking. Less volatile and stronger spices are used at the start in a pounded or whole form when they are fried in oil to leech out the flavour. More aromatic ones like green cardamom are added at finish, for aroma. This creates a sort of pyramid of smells,\" says restaurateur and chef Marut Sikka. What he is describing is the artful layering of flavours, almost like the construction of a perfume that is the hallmark of Indian food.  Garam masala, which is always added at the finish and not while starting off a dish, may have been concocted as a hack to mask shortcomings in basic cooking, feel Sikka and Gill. A combination of \"hot\" spices with a predominance of pepper originally, the masala may also have been concocted exclusively for heavier winter recipes such as meat stews to keep the body warm. It is interesting to note that traditional families in Old Delhi use different garam masala (made at home) in winter and summer.  \"Not all ingredients go into the masala for summer. Cloves, nutmeg and mace are not used in the summer because they have a warm taseer (property, according to Ayurveda ),\" says Ashok Mathur, a fourth generation resident of Old Delhi.  Curry Powder Confusion Spice combinations have always eluded Western understanding. A 19th century cookery book for English memsahibs written by Henrietta A Hervey gives a glimpse into the utter confusion around these. Hervey gives recipes for three \u00a1\u00a7curry powders\u00a1\u00a8\u00a1X Madras curry powder, Bombay curry powder and Bengal curry powder, corresponding to the three presidencies under the Raj. Curry powder, as we know, is a British invention.     As I go through the recipes, it becomes clear how little the British really understood regional cuisines. The Madras curry powder, for instance, lists three quarter pounds of saffron as a key ingredient. There is no logic to this since the ingredient is not intrinsic to southern India. The recipes are more or less similar with just small differences in proportions and addition cinnamon in the Bengal recipe. Luckily, no one in India uses curry powder.  The diversity of our cooking is still preserved because every home and micro region uses its own spice mixes. Those such as the bottle masala of the east Indians, various sambhar powders and goda masala came about as conveniences. Home cooks started assembling their own spice combinations and storing these but still maintained their individual recipes that differ home to home. Packaged retail versions of these will not only take away our culinary diversity but also our understanding of spicing. If Indian cooking is to spread globally, one key challenge is to demystify spicing and make the public at large understand its nuances.

The PE fund that holds around 80% stake in the company expects to barely recover the amount it invested in the business nine years back.  \u201cThe PE investor is growing impatient as it has stayed its course. However, the buyers are not ready to pay such a hefty valuation,\u201d said a person involved in the discussions. The sale process, the person added, is driven by Pradeep Guha, the channel's chief executive officer who also owns around 15% stake in the company.  Owing to poor demand the PE fund and other shareholders have been engaging with prospective buyers on and off for the last two years.  9X Media operates five music channels - 9XM (Bollywood music), 9X Tashan (Punjabi music), 9X Jalwa (retro bollywood hits), 9X Jhakaas (Marathi music) and 9XO (International music).  Pradeep Guha did not respond to emailed questionnaire mailed a week back. But an official with direct knowledge of the sale process confirmed the talks being on track. NSR spokesperson in an emailed response said, \u201cWe are committed to providing returns to our investors and are optimistic about liquidity events in 2016. However, NSR would not like to offer any comments on market speculations.\u201d Spokesperson for Sony Pictures Network India Ltd in an emailed response said, \u201cAs a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation.\u201d  Founded by now jailed couple Peter Mukerjea and Indrani Mukerjea as INX Media in 2006, the company was 30% previously owned by PE funds NSR, Kotak Equity Fund, Temasek and New Vernon. Kotak, Temasek and New Vernon sold their stake in the company to NSR in 2009.  Pradeep Guha was roped in in 2009 by NSR to turnaround the loss making business. Guha came on board with a 15% stake in the company. Guha, worked with NSR to restructure the business by selling the loss making Hindi general entertainment channel 9X to Zee Entertainment. INX News was subsequently sold to Indi Media.  In 2015, NSR exited from four companies. It part exited from one of India's largest logistic provider VRL Logistics and Ortel Communications through initial public offers. The fund also holds stake in the now listed quick service restaurant chain Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day. The fund also sold its financial services business of Destimoney to global private equity fund PE fund Carlyle in February. The fund returned more than $200 million last year.  NSR, which was founded by Rajat Gupta and Parag Saxena in 2006 and has more than $1.6 billion under management is looking to exit some of its other investments this year after which it will start raising its new $500 million fund. The other investments that NSR is waiting to exit from includes Rolex Rings, Reliance Infratel, Ascend Tele and Moshe\u2019s.", "published_date": "Mar 03, 2016, 05.09 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:44", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/new-silk-route-pradeep-guha-in-talks-with-sony-to-sell-9x-media/articleshow/51226359.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

The former president of Calcutta Chambers of Commerce has accepted a proposal from DCHL\u2019s single largest stakeholder, Srei Infrastructure Finance, to infuse fresh capital into the beleaguered media house.  Mohanka told ET, \u201cThere is huge potential in turning the publication around, but it cannot be done with the existing debt even if some miracle takes place. If all the stakeholders buy into the proposed scheme of compromise, then there is certainly huge opportunity for a turnaround.\u201d  The move comes even as ICICI Bank , a large creditor of DCHL, is contesting the stakeholding of Srei Infra Finance, which was allotted 6.6 crore shares of Rs 2 each, constituting 24% stake, by DCHL management in January 2015.  ICICI Bank, which had in February 2015 announced the acquisition of 24.9% stake in DCHL through invocation of pledged shares, argues that the allotment amounted to breach of an interim stay issued by the courts.  Srei Infra has obtained approval of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad to convene a meeting of DCHL stakeholders for a scheme of compromise and arrangement.  The court-convened meeting, to be held on March 19, will consider the proposals on reorganisation of DCHL\u2019s share capital, writing off 75% of accumulated losses and converting 25% of losses (Rs 996.87 crore) into equity and debt instruments.  As of September end 2012, DCHL has accumulated losses ofRs 513 crore and the meeting on March 19 proposes to write offRs 52.25 crore of losses against the paid-up capital of DCHL.  The media house currently has paidup equity of Rs 55 crore. Manoj Mohanka proposes to infuse Rs 30 crore as equity and unsecured loans to take charge of the day-to-day affairs of the firm.  Hemant Kanoria, chairman of Srei Infra group, said, \u201cAll the legal efforts... were aimed at reviving the company and realising our monies.\u201d  Repeated efforts to reach DCHL chairman Venkattram Reddy failed to elicit any response.", "published_date": "Mar 03, 2016, 05.12 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:47", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/manoj-mohanka-may-acquire-deccan-chronicle/articleshow/51233299.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Future Retail, the largest shareholder, offloaded 14% and Hong Kong-based Li & Fung exited by selling its 26% stake in the logistics company.  Fung Capital, the PE investment arm of the families of Victor Fung and William Fung that controls Li & Fung in Hong Kong, received about Rs 380 crore ($57 million) for its stake, according to people familiar with the deal. It had invested $30 million to acquire the stake in 2009.   Future Retail still owns a 57% stake in the company, which has been valued at Rs 1,450 crore. Singapore-based Bantry Capital was the sole advisor for the transaction, according to a joint statement by SSG and Future Retail. Hong Kong-based SSG Capital, founded by Shyam Maheshwari, has about $2 billion of assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region.  Started as Future Logistics to cater to group companies, Future Supply Chain Solutions later expanded and now gets about 55% of its revenue from clients including ITC, Tata Motors and Mondelez, according to Anshuman Singh, the managing director.  Over the years, it extended its services to ecommerce and counts Snapdeal and PepperFry among its customers.For the year ended March 2015, Future Supply Chain made a profit of Rs 25 crore on revenues of Rs 408 crore.  This is the second India investment for SSG Capital. In 2014, the PE firm acquired a 49% stake in Asset Care & Reconstruction Enterprise for Rs 41 crore, marking the first entry of an overseas investor in asset reconstruction through the foreign direct investment route. Amid rapid growth of ecommerce as well as the potential of the overall supply chain sector in India, foreign investors and PE firms have been showing increasing appetite for warehousing and logistics companies in the country.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Baker Tilly DHC forms alliance to take on India's big four chartered accountant firms</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Baker Tilly DHC , the Indian arm of Baker Tilly, has formed an alliance with five smaller chartered accountant firms in the country. Baker Tilly DHC, which currently has about 1,300 people on board including about 100 partners in India, would add more than 500 people after the integration. As per the new operational integration design, all new firms would now come under one umbrella and called Baker Tilly DHC. Some senior partners in five firms would also get some national roles in the new firm. Dilip B Desai, chairman, Baker Tilly DHC, confirmed the development, but refused to share the names. \u201cThis is not an outright acquisition of the smaller firms as employees and their clients would be part of Baker Tilly DHC,\u201c he said. In at least one of the five cases, Baker Tilly DHC would also make a payment to some senior partners for them to join the network. ET has learnt that three of the five firms include Cloud Info-solutions , R Kothari & Co, Spearhead Services . He also added that the firm is now looking for similar integration with 10 separate smaller firms. Talks with these firms are in the final stages, he said. Industry trackers say that this is just the beginning of the deal activity in the professional services firms. Many firms are also looking at an outright acquisition of the smaller firms. The activity in the space is mainly due to the new Companies Act which, after it comes into force in from next financial year, will make it mandatory for Indian companies to change their auditors every 10 years. There are different views on how audit rotation would impact the auditing firms, but it is speculated that the Big Four--Deloitte, EY, PwC and KPMG--could end up eating into smaller firms' pie. Due to this some of the other firms beyond the Big Four have been trying to increase their size and footprint to stand a fighting chance against the big boys. Most major auditing firms, including BDO and Grant Thornton to other domestic firms like Mumbai-based MGB & Co, are on a look out to acquire smaller firms. In September 2014, Grant Thornton's acquisition of Mumbai-based Thingna & Contractor was one of the major ones. The smaller firms are pushed to the wall & combining their strengths can only be their chance to take on the Big Four. Till now, many big companies have had non Big Four companies auditing them like Singhi & Co has been auditing Hindalco for over 50 years and Chaturvedi and Shah been working with Reliance for over three decades. Post this deal, Baker Tilly DHC -Baker Tilly network globally has 27,000 people in 137 countries --is set to become one of the top six firms in India by number of people and revenue. The new firms would bring in so me of the capabilities that Baker Tilly DHC would require to compete with the big boys. Like Spearhead has a team of over 200 people servicing more than 100 Fortune 500 multinational companies in India. \u201cThis integration between Baker Tilly DHC and Spearhead creates a formidable partnership that can re-define customer delivery globally . It brings the best of IT with the best of accounting practices to provide unparalleled values to businesses,\u201c said K R Rajagopalan, Chairman, Spearhead.

In an interesting diversification move that has raised eyebrows of most competitors, Piramal, chairman of the over $4 billion eponymous group, has thrown his hat in the ring as Lafarge last month initiated plans to sell its entire Indian operations of 11 million tonnes per annum for an estimated $1.5 to $2 billion, said multiple sources aware of the transaction.   Ever since he sold his flagship pharma business for a jaw dropping $3.8 billion six years ago, there has been endless speculation on what could be Ajay Piramal\u2019s next big play. A fair chunk of the money so far has already gone into financial services , real estate and infrastructure. Now betting on the long term India growth story, Piramal, a quintessential deal maker, looks poised to place a mega bet on cement.  When contacted spokespersons from Piramal Enterprises and Lafarge India declined to comment.  At the core of Piramal\u2019s investment thesis, say sources, is his belief that in the next 12-18 months, spending on infrastructure will pick up as India looks to bounce back on its 8% plus growth trajectory. The group already has legacy manufacturing expertise that can be exploited going forward. \u201cFrom railways to highways and roads, we are looking at several high profile projects taking off in the next 1-2 years. Cement will be the building blocks and at the core of it,\u201d said an official in the know. \u201cThis is a long term business that is unlikely to get disrupted by change in technology,\u201d he added.  Piramal is not looking to use Piramal Enterprises, the listed group flagship housing his healthcare, financial services and information management business for the Lafarge acquisition. Instead, one of his private companies or a family investment arm will be the likely vehicle for the transaction. However, the talks are still in early stages, cautioned these officials. It is also not clear as yet if Piramal would go solo or opt for a financial partner subsequently if they indeed progress to the final rounds of negotiations.  With large assets available for consolidation along with savvy management teams, some believe this is also the best time to enter the space and build a cement platform by backing the right management teams and scale up. One of the sources cited above even said headhunting firms have also been approached to scout for senior management personnel for the new foray and feelers have already gone out to a handful of top talent in existing firms, but this could not be independently verified.  \u201cLafarge is be a marquee asset and arguably the best opportunity if one is looking at scaled operations. Along with assets even the incumbent management team will move to the new acquirer. So for a newer entrant who is looking at this space seriously, this is one of the best opportunities available to build on, \u201d said an cement sector analyst privy to the ongoing discussions.  Buyouts are also a faster than the build option to save on time and costs. Currently, it takes over five years to set up a cement plant, largely on account of land acquisition delays.  While some see this as an opportunistic exercise by Piramal to branch into a sunrise sector, many see the development as a natural extension of his existing interest in real estate and infrastructure. \u201cFrom clean tech to roads, from telecom to real estate, the conglomerate has used its structured finance group to lend to various core sector projects. But that is largely through debt financing. This will be unique as it is a big strategic move to actually run the cement business as an operator using the equity route,\u201d said an investment banker who works closely with the group.  Since 2011, Piramal's son Anand has also ventured into real estate development with Piramal Realty and is developing 10 million sq ft across 6 projects in Mumbai. Additionally, with over $3 billion parked through several of their sector focussed funds and lending arms, Piramals are today the second largest investor in realty after HDFC.  Interestingly, in the recent past Piramal\u2019s structured investment team has already spent considerable time studying the sector, evaluating mezzanine financing opportunities to private equity funds and cement players during recent cement M&As \u2013 like the divestment of Reliance Cement and two of Lafarge\u2019s eastern Indian assets. The in-house knowledge will help them as the race to acquire Lafarge will intensify in the coming months.  In February, LafargeHolcim had agreed to sell its entire India operations after regulatory hurdle over transfer of mines came in between its earlier plans to divest 2 of its assets to Birla Corp for Rs 5000 crore. Exiting the entire business was alternate remedy for the merger of LafargeHolcim\u2019s legacy Indian operations. LafargeHolcim\u2019s India presence comprises cement capacity held under three subsidiaries\u2014Lafarge India Pvt. Ltd, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd. Post divestment of Lafarge\u2019s 11 million tonnes, the merged entity would have a total capacity of about 60 million tonnes.", "published_date": "Mar 03, 2016, 05.19 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:48", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/cement/ajay-piramal-eyes-lafarges-india-business-chooses-cement-as-his-next-big-play/articleshow/51231586.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Three people close to the situation said the Prem Watsa-controlled Thomas Cook is in advanced talks to buy Sterling at a 36% premium to the firm's market price. Thomas Cook is likely to pay Rs 125 per share, 36% premium to Sterling's price of Rs 98 a share, valuing the firm at Rs 852 crore. Sterling managing director Ramesh Ramanathan and Thomas Cook MD Madhavan Menon did not answer specific questions on the subject. Bay Capital, which bought 13.67% in Sterling in 2009, is expected to review Thomas Cook's final proposal by the end of this week, the three investment bankers said. Sterling shares rose 0.83% at Rs 91.5 Monday with a market capitalisation of Rs 624 crore against rival and market leader Mahindra Holidays' Rs 2,000-crore market value. Sterling shares have risen 33% in the past three months. Watsa, who bought Thomas Cook in 2012, is a well-known value investor with a disciplined approach and a habit of buying companies cheap and turning them around. DEAL WILL HELP STERLING: ANALYSTS \"To find value investment, you must focus on price,\" Watsa said in an interview to ET last month. Sterling's attempt at creating a string of holiday resorts on the lines of Club Mahindra did not get off to a good start and the firm plunged into losses in 2008-09. The turnaround started with Bay's $13.9-million investment in 2009 and Sterling's chairman and managing director R Subramanian relinquishing control. The deal was helped by the fact that Bay Capital's chief executive Siddharth Metha and Subramanian's son were schoolmates.  Bay brought in former Mahindra Holidays MD Ramesh Ramanathan to steer the company out of troubled times. Ramanathan bought fresh lease of life into operations through a series of customercentric measures. The company sold some of its non-core assets to software companies and settled its dues. \"Ramanathan brought expats to boost service capabilities. Lots of old customers are now back,\" said a travel industry executive. Overall room nights for the company have increased from 158,000 in 2010-11 to 201,000 in 2012-13. Average occupancy was up from 19% to 43% in the same period. The company posted its first quarterly net profit of Rs 62 lakh in June last year due to improved occupancy levels at its resorts. While main promoter Bay owns 13.67%, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakrishna Damani own 3.67% and 6.47%, respectively. Amit Goela, ex-CEO of Alchemy, owns around 2.35%. Ramanathan owns 2.86%. Sterling is yet to catch up with the leader, Mahindra Holidays. While Mahindra has a total membership base of 170,000, Sterling has only 67,000 members. Analysts feel that a deal with Thomas Cook will help Sterling in properly channelising the traffic of customers. \"For a travel services company to start providing hotel stay would be a vertical integration move \u2013 and they could benefit by channelisng the traffic of customers it helps to plan holidays,\" says Naimish Dave, Partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, a management consulting firm. \"The two businesses are quite different, as one is an asset-light model and the other is an asset-heavy one. Further, the aspect of utilisation of rooms will now become the primary concern.\" His comments are not specific to the story.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Godrej looking to acquire personal care companies in with war chest of Rs 3,000 crore</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) plans another shopping spree over the next few years as it looks to acquire home and personal care companies in Africa , Indonesia and India with a war chest of Rs 3,000 crore.  \u201cLast few years we have consolidated the previous buys and in the next couple, we are ready to acquire more firms in similar space,\u201d said GCPL managing director Vivek Gambir. \u201cOur current debt to equity ratio is about 0.35\u2026 We are ready to push it to 0.8-0.9.'' A lower debt to equity or leverage ratio indicates the financial health of a company. GCPL has about Rs 950 crore of cash on its balance sheet.  The maker of GoodKnight mosquito repellent and Cinthol soap gets nearly half its sales from international businesses, mainly Indonesia and Africa. In the the past decade, GCPL has acquired nearly half a dozen companies and brands in Africa, including hair colour brand Rapidol (2006) and hair extensions brand Kinky (2008). It bought Nigerian personal care brand Tura in 2010 and hair extension brand Darling in 2011.  These acquisitions were followed in 2015 with Frika, a South African hair-extensions brand, and a 75% stake in Canon Chemicals, which makes products ranging from lotions to detergents.  Africa accounts for 35% of GCPL\u2019s international revenue. \u201cHigher per-capita sales come from Indonesia, Kenya, Chile, Uruguay and the United Kingdom, said Godrej group chairman Adi Godrej.  Experts expect growth in Indonesia and Africa to slow due to the weak macro environment , currency devaluation and oil-dependent economies being stricken by lower crude prices. Hence, the renewed focus on acquisition.  The group's acquisition strategy hinges on identifying unlisted companies built by entrepreneurs looking for capital, picking up stakes and working with them to scale up their businesses.  \u201cThe group, as a policy, stays away from hostile takeovers and chooses to work together with companies,'' a senior official said.  According to a BNP Paribas report, GCPL\u2019s presence in fast-growing, under-penetrated categories and intense focus on volume growth in emerging markets led by innovation will pay off in the long term. It has also been successful in cross-pollinating its products across geographies, thereby significantly reducing the time taken to bring products to market, said the report.  While Godrej has nearly a dozen own brands, consultants said companies prefer to acquire them, especially to enter newer markets or consumer categories.  \u201cCompanies prefer to buy brands than build because it reduces costs of media, looking into new distribution channels. If the right fit is spotted, then buying them makes sense,\u201d said Rajat Wahi, head of consumer markets and agricultural sector, KPMG India. \u201cAfrica, Indonesia are similar markets like India with high growth, similar retail profile and therefore for players in the consumer sector it makes sense not to head out into many other geographies.''  As part of Godrej\u2019s other growth plans, premium retail chain Nature\u2019s Basket will start selling ready to eat meals. GCPL is keen to enter the health and wellness space, especially in the herbal categories. So far, its products have been limited to hand sanitizers and mosquito repellents using natural ingredients under the Protekt brand.  The overall ayurvedic space is getting increasingly competitive, especially after Emami's acquisition of Kesh King Hair oil and Hindustan Unilever's deal to purchase Indulekha. GCPL's plan is to roll out a health and wellness range to compete with category leaders such as Himalaya.  The country's ayurvedic products segment grew 23% to Rs3,700 crore in 2015, faster than the overall fast moving consumer goods market that grew 6%, according to the latest IMRB data.", "published_date": "Mar 07, 2016, 05.15 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:55:55", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/godrej-looking-to-acquire-personal-care-companies-in-with-war-chest-of-rs-3000-crore/articleshow/51283134.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Link and Karvy executives are to meet Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) officials early this week to discuss the matter.  Sebi last week barred Sharepro, its promoters and directors from the capital markets and asked all companies to switch their activities to other registered share transfer agents after it found lapses.

The alliance will herald the emergence of domestic consultancy firms in the global domain, which is dominated by the Big Four, and provides an opportunity to strengthen India\u2019s brand image in services. As a first step, DHC has agreed to join the network of London-headquartered Baker Tilly International this month. Baker Tilly International, the world\u2019s eighthlargest network of accountancy and business advisory firms, had a global revenue of $3.4 billion, with 27,000 people, including 2,750 partners, across 137 countries. The GCE will function as a high-end knowledge centre. It will hire chartered accountants, management graduates, IT professionals and others and develop their skills to offer specialised services in assurance, risk advisory, global tax, corporate finance including M&A and knowledge services. Services will be offered at a lower cost than international levels with the aim of boosting the potential revenue of firms in the Baker Tilly network. The GCE proposes to have offices across several cities to create job opportunities for the local population. DHC, formed in April 2013 after the country\u2019s two biggest auditing firms \u2014 Haribhakti & Co and DB Desai & Co \u2014 joined forces, will also set up a skill institution with international collaboration to train fresh graduates and transform them into top-notch professionals. DHC group chairman Shailesh V Haribhakti and chairman Dilip B Desai are expected to play crucial roles at the global level. \u201cWe are confident that this will transform the landscape of professional services in India and the competence of Indian professionals in the accounting, corporate and tax world would be a major force to reckon with,\u201d said Desai. The alliance was inspired by Modi\u2019s plan to boost skill development and turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse through the \u2018Make in India\u2019 drive. India is short of skilled manpower due to decades of neglected training. The shortage means that India could fritter away the potential of 12 million people stepping into the job market every year. Minister for skill development Rajeev Pratap Rudy recently inaugurated a plan to convert 6,000 railway stations into skill development centres for the youth. \u201cWe are quite excited with the developments in the Indian subcontinent under the new government and the proactive role being played by Narendra Modi himself in reaching out to the global leaders and the global communities. Some of the notable initiatives in this regard are \u2018Make in India\u2019 and \u2018Skill India,\u2019 said James Castellano, Chairman of Baker Tilly International. The alliance also symbolises the desire of domestic consultancy firms to expand their global footprint and challenge the dominance of the Big Four. \u201cServices like business advisory, which GCE shall render to the global market, are high-potential, big-ticket items that shall further strengthen India\u2019s brand image in services,\u201d said Desai. FTI Consulting, a New York Stock Exchange-listed corporate advisory firm, has teamed up with Desai Haribhakti to ramp up its presence in forensics or corporate investigations. Currently, the Big Four \u2014 EY, KPMG , Deloitte and PwC \u2014 are the leading players in this space, while others such as Kroll and Grant Thornton are widening their presence in this niche business.", "published_date": "Jan 23, 2015, 05.50 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:56:14", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/consultancy-/-audit/Baker-Tilly-DHC-to-set-up-global-skill-centre/articleshow/45985983.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

In an interview with TOI, Alstom chairman and CEO Henri Poupart-Lafarge discusses the company\u2019s strategy in India, including plans to bring electric buses and hydrogen trains. While high-speed trains are a focus for Alstom too, the company\u2019s global chief is not particularly pleased with the Japanese \u201ctied aid\u201d model that India has opted for. Excerpts:   Do you spot some changes in India? The first time I visited was in 2000 and I have been here many times since then. There has been a tremendous change in terms of size and scale of what we do in India. What we do in transportation has been multiplied by 10. Speed of implementation has has improved.   But there are railway projects going on for 40 years. Has execution actually changed? Delhi Metro started more than 15 years ago and it has grown. The momentum has changed from one city to a large number of cities. For Indian Railways, in two years, we have developed locomotives in Madhepura, set up a new factory and manufactured. The speed of implementation has been fantastic. We built it in joint venture with Indian Railways and they did everything from certification onwards.   What are the focus areas for you? Our focus is to add new technologies, and engineering capabilities in India. In the last 10 years, we have reached a stage where everything that\u2019s needed is done in India \u2014 we have a factory in Coimbatore, for metros in Chennai and now one for locomotives in Madhepura. We will add manufacturing capabilities. Engineering is growing 20-25% every year. Now, we have 1,500 engineers in Bangalore, which is more than 20% of all engineers in Alstom. Manufacturing capability for India and global operations is 50:50. On engineering, it is 80:20.   Any other areas that you are interested in? Electrification, of course. It is the future \u2014 whether you talk about electrification using catenaries, or the introduction of hydrogen trains, which is a terrific product to get rid of diesel. It has been worked out in Germany and a lot of countries have tested it out, including Canada. The cost of this train is similar to a cost of a normal train. But then, there is a cost of infrastructure which is difficult to estimate. We need to have hydrogen tanks on the poles, etc. It is a very good combination with renewable energy. Because when you have excess power, you transform that into hydrogen.   Talking about high-speed trains. India went with Japan partly because of the funding. How do you compete with these kinds of models? We are totally dedicated to the \u2018Make in India\u2019 policy. We want to leverage that, localise and probably get some local financing. Of course, if you have external financing tied to loans, then, they will not comply with a \u2018Make in India policy\u2019. That\u2019s another way of doing business but we are not there.   How do you compete when technologies are pushed based on funding? In the case of Japan, you have seen that in some situations an input from Japan can at the end of the day, cost more to the Indian authority than making locally with local financing. What is being bought through Japanese financing from Japan might at the end of the day be more expensive than products being made by Japan in India.

In response to an email query, a spokesperson for Rolex Rings confirmed that PE investors were looking at investing and added, \u201cpromoters are not willing to dilute further of their stake.\u201d Rolex manufactures various types of rings like ball bearing, tapered, cylindrical, spherical, railway bearing components, spacers with additional operations like drilling, milling and marking that is widely used by companies in automotive and industrial sector. The company has been under financial stress for the past three years.

Batria, in his 33 years of building experience has also been associated with Tata Steel (Cement division), Century Textiles & Industries (Cement division) and Eicher Motors and has held key leadership positions.  \"We continue to strengthen our leadership team and are pleased to have Mr. Ujjwal on board to head our manufacturing, sales & marketing and logistics teams,\" said Mahendra Singhi, group CEO at Dalmia Cement (Bharat). \"We are confident that his rich experience and leadership will be a tremendous asset for driving further our growth story,\" Singhi said.  Dalmia Bharat has been on a major growth drive which is led by the acquisition of distressed cement assets that the company has undertaken since last year. Under the bankruptcy code, the Puneet Dalmia led company has bid for three companies including the 6 MT Binani Cement, the 3 MT Murli Industries and the 1 MT Kalyanpur Cement; assets that will collectively help the company increase scale as well as tap unexplored markets in the heavily regional cement business.  Out of these, while Murli Industries and Kalyanpur Cement has been bagged by Dalmia Bharat, bidding for Binani Cement saw it locking horns with cement giant UltraTech and is likely to result in the latter's favour.  Batria's appointment is a part of the organization\u2019s effort to build strategic leadership team for its various growth initiatives.

The alliance will herald the emergence of domestic consultancy firms in the global domain, which is dominated by the Big Four, and provides an opportunity to strengthen India\u2019s brand image in services. As a first step, DHC has agreed to join the network of London-headquartered Baker Tilly International this month. Baker Tilly International, the world\u2019s eighthlargest network of accountancy and business advisory firms, had a global revenue of $3.4 billion, with 27,000 people, including 2,750 partners, across 137 countries. The GCE will function as a high-end knowledge centre. It will hire chartered accountants, management graduates, IT professionals and others and develop their skills to offer specialised services in assurance, risk advisory, global tax, corporate finance including M&A and knowledge services. Services will be offered at a lower cost than international levels with the aim of boosting the potential revenue of firms in the Baker Tilly network. The GCE proposes to have offices across several cities to create job opportunities for the local population. DHC, formed in April 2013 after the country\u2019s two biggest auditing firms \u2014 Haribhakti & Co and DB Desai & Co \u2014 joined forces, will also set up a skill institution with international collaboration to train fresh graduates and transform them into top-notch professionals. DHC group chairman Shailesh V Haribhakti and chairman Dilip B Desai are expected to play crucial roles at the global level. \u201cWe are confident that this will transform the landscape of professional services in India and the competence of Indian professionals in the accounting, corporate and tax world would be a major force to reckon with,\u201d said Desai. The alliance was inspired by Modi\u2019s plan to boost skill development and turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse through the \u2018Make in India\u2019 drive. India is short of skilled manpower due to decades of neglected training. The shortage means that India could fritter away the potential of 12 million people stepping into the job market every year. Minister for skill development Rajeev Pratap Rudy recently inaugurated a plan to convert 6,000 railway stations into skill development centres for the youth. \u201cWe are quite excited with the developments in the Indian subcontinent under the new government and the proactive role being played by Narendra Modi himself in reaching out to the global leaders and the global communities. Some of the notable initiatives in this regard are \u2018Make in India\u2019 and \u2018Skill India,\u2019 said James Castellano, Chairman of Baker Tilly International. The alliance also symbolises the desire of domestic consultancy firms to expand their global footprint and challenge the dominance of the Big Four. \u201cServices like business advisory, which GCE shall render to the global market, are high-potential, big-ticket items that shall further strengthen India\u2019s brand image in services,\u201d said Desai. FTI Consulting, a New York Stock Exchange-listed corporate advisory firm, has teamed up with Desai Haribhakti to ramp up its presence in forensics or corporate investigations. Currently, the Big Four \u2014 EY, KPMG , Deloitte and PwC \u2014 are the leading players in this space, while others such as Kroll and Grant Thornton are widening their presence in this niche business.", "published_date": "Jan 23, 2015, 05.50 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:56:33", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/consultancy-/-audit/baker-tilly-dhc-to-set-up-global-skill-centre/articleshow/45985983.cms", "source": "ecospd"},
{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Baker Tilly DHC forms alliance to take on India's big four chartered accountant firms</h1>", "description": "MUMBAI: Baker Tilly DHC , the Indian arm of Baker Tilly, has formed an alliance with five smaller chartered accountant firms in the country. Baker Tilly DHC, which currently has about 1,300 people on board including about 100 partners in India, would add more than 500 people after the integration. As per the new operational integration design, all new firms would now come under one umbrella and called Baker Tilly DHC. Some senior partners in five firms would also get some national roles in the new firm. Dilip B Desai, chairman, Baker Tilly DHC, confirmed the development, but refused to share the names. \u201cThis is not an outright acquisition of the smaller firms as employees and their clients would be part of Baker Tilly DHC,\u201c he said. In at least one of the five cases, Baker Tilly DHC would also make a payment to some senior partners for them to join the network. ET has learnt that three of the five firms include Cloud Info-solutions , R Kothari & Co, Spearhead Services . He also added that the firm is now looking for similar integration with 10 separate smaller firms. Talks with these firms are in the final stages, he said. Industry trackers say that this is just the beginning of the deal activity in the professional services firms. Many firms are also looking at an outright acquisition of the smaller firms. The activity in the space is mainly due to the new Companies Act which, after it comes into force in from next financial year, will make it mandatory for Indian companies to change their auditors every 10 years. There are different views on how audit rotation would impact the auditing firms, but it is speculated that the Big Four--Deloitte, EY, PwC and KPMG--could end up eating into smaller firms' pie. Due to this some of the other firms beyond the Big Four have been trying to increase their size and footprint to stand a fighting chance against the big boys. Most major auditing firms, including BDO and Grant Thornton to other domestic firms like Mumbai-based MGB & Co, are on a look out to acquire smaller firms. In September 2014, Grant Thornton's acquisition of Mumbai-based Thingna & Contractor was one of the major ones. The smaller firms are pushed to the wall & combining their strengths can only be their chance to take on the Big Four. Till now, many big companies have had non Big Four companies auditing them like Singhi & Co has been auditing Hindalco for over 50 years and Chaturvedi and Shah been working with Reliance for over three decades. Post this deal, Baker Tilly DHC -Baker Tilly network globally has 27,000 people in 137 countries --is set to become one of the top six firms in India by number of people and revenue. The new firms would bring in so me of the capabilities that Baker Tilly DHC would require to compete with the big boys. Like Spearhead has a team of over 200 people servicing more than 100 Fortune 500 multinational companies in India. \u201cThis integration between Baker Tilly DHC and Spearhead creates a formidable partnership that can re-define customer delivery globally . It brings the best of IT with the best of accounting practices to provide unparalleled values to businesses,\u201c said K R Rajagopalan, Chairman, Spearhead.

New Silk Route, promoted by Rajat Gupta and Parag Saxena , bought around 26% stake in the Rajkot, Gujarat-based Rolex Rings for $40 million in 2007. \u201cThe PE fund has stayed its course in the company and is now looking at exiting by either selling to another private equity investor or a strategic investor,\u201d an investment banker with knowledge of the development said. Investment banker and an advisor to the fund Rajeev Gupta is helping the fund exit its investment in Rolex. A spokesperson for NSR did not respond to queries from ET. In response to an email query, a spokesperson for Rolex Rings confirmed that PE investors were looking at investing and added, \u201cpromoters are not willing to dilute further of their stake.\u201d Rolex manufactures various types of rings like ball bearing, tapered, cylindrical, spherical, railway bearing components, spacers with additional operations like drilling, milling and marking that is widely used by companies in automotive and industrial sector. The company has been under financial stress for the past three years. According to an August 2013 ratings release by India Credit Rating Agency (ICRA), the company has irregular debt repayment in the past on account of stretched liquidity position, which subsequently led to implementation of Corporate Debt Restructuring on March 31, 2013. \u201cThe ratings also factor the company\u2019s weak financial profile as reflected by continued losses at net level, negative net worth position as on March 31, 2013 and high working capital intensity owing to long receivables, coupled with high inventory holding periods,\u201d the release said.

Saudi Aramco, world\u2019s largest oil exporter, is believed to have first shown interest in Reliance about four months ago but the talks gathered momentum after Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) visited India in February.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">View: India should beware of Saudi Aramco's billions</h1>", "description": "By David Fickling   It\u2019s funny how friendly someone gets when they\u2019re trying to sell you something.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is doing its best to make nice with one of its biggest customers. With the ink barely dry on the takeover of 70 percent of the country\u2019s chemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. and the issuance of its first-ever corporate bond, Aramco is looking to buy a stake in the world\u2019s biggest oil refinery.  Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. is seeking to sell as much as a quarter of its refining business for at least $10 billion and is entertaining offers from Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News this week.  That represents quite a prize. Reliance\u2019s Jamnagar refinery is about twice the size of the biggest U.S. plant, Aramco-owned Port Arthur, and is so massive that maintenance work occasionally skews India\u2019s entire trade balance.  Trade is also the reason India should be cautious of Aramco\u2019s embrace. The country has a dangerous addiction to imported crude, and it should be wary of getting too cozy with its dealer.     For more than a century, the rise of major economic powers has been fueled by petroleum. The U.S. is both the world\u2019s biggest oil consumer and its biggest producer. The Soviet Union was built on its oilfields in the Caucasus and Siberia. While China has overtaken America as the biggest oil importer, it\u2019s also the biggest producer outside the Middle East after the U.S., Russia and Canada.  India is different. The U.S. produces about 1.8 metric tons of oil a year per capita and even China manages 138 kilograms. India \u2013 at a far earlier stage of development than either country \u2013 ekes out just 30 kilograms. Production peaked all the way back in 2010, and shows no sign of recovery. Industrialization is an energy-intensive process. If India\u2019s development is going to be powered by crude oil, it\u2019s going to be buying a whole lot more from Aramco and its ilk.  Such a future would pose some profound risks. Balance of payments crises are a recurring danger for emerging economies, and even at its current stage of development oil typically accounts for about a quarter of India\u2019s imports. If prices spike higher \u2013 as, inevitably, they will from time to time \u2013 that\u2019s good news for Riyadh, but potentially devastating for New Delhi.     When crude is averaging $85 a barrel \u2013 roughly the level at which Saudi Arabia can balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund \u2013 oil imports would reduce India\u2019s gross domestic product by about 3.6 percentage points, according to a study this year by the Reserve Bank of India. Higher prices will also push up inflation and weaken the government\u2019s fiscal position, the authors found.  At present, that dynamic is somewhat mitigated by the fact that about a third of India\u2019s oil imports are re-exported as petroleum products, giving the country a natural hedge against rising prices. Jamnagar, for instance, produces almost exclusively for export, meaning that it probably makes a modestly positive contribution to the trade balance since oil products are more valuable than the crude they\u2019re made from.  Should domestic consumption grow faster than export refinery capacity, though, India\u2019s oil dependence will start taking a deeper bite out of its current account. In a worst-case scenario, a spike in oil prices could drive the country toward a balance of payments crisis like the one it suffered in 1991, when a splurge on oil imports over the previous decade resulted in New Delhi pledging its gold reserves as security for bailouts from multilateral lenders.  India is aware that its dependence on imported crude risks constraining growth. The government wants 30 percent of new cars and two-wheelers to be electric by 2030 and is already home to more than 1.5 million electric rickshaws. It\u2019s also adjusted tax policies to encourage that transition. In a country at grave risk from climate change, whose cities are already choking on vehicle smog, reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels is more than just an issue for the current account.  That goal isn\u2019t an unrealistic one given the rock-bottom local cost of wind and solar. Still, no country has managed a low-carbon industrialization on this scale before, so it won\u2019t be easy \u2013 and Saudi Arabia will be hoping it proves all but impossible. By promising to buy a chunk of Reliance and help fund a new $44 billion Jamnagar-sized refinery in western India, Aramco is counting on the country being unable to kick its self-destructive oil habit. Indians should hope that it\u2019s wrong.

This was announced by Sajjan Jindal , chairman JSW Group on Thursday. Jindal was speaking at the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS).  Jindal, however, did not mention the investment required for the capacity addition. A JSW official said the project is being given final touches and the investment would be firmed up soon.  This hike in capacity is in line JSW Cement 's commitment to strengthen its presence in eastern India, starting with West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand.  Inaugurated in January 2018, the manufacturing unit at Salboni has already become an integral part of JSW Cement\u2019s growth story in the east. JSW Cement now has a distribution network comprising over 3,700 dealers and retailers in West Bengal.  At the BGBS, Jindal also announced plans to set up a 1,000 mw pumped storage energy project where investment is likely to be around $1 billion.  Jindal was among a clutch of top industrialists and businessmen like Mukesh Ambani chairman Reliance Industries, real estate magnate Niranjan Hiranandani of Hiranandani group, Y K Modi executive chairman of Great Eastern Energy Corporation, Sanjiv Goenka CEO, RP-Sanjiv Goenka group and Harsh Neotia chairman of Ambuja Neotia group who are attending the fifth edition of BGBS.  Also at Salboni, where JSW has nearly 4,000 acres of land, Sangita Jindal, wife of Sajjan Jindal and chairman of JSW Foundation, is planning to set up a museum on the partition of Bengal that led to the creation of East Pakistan, later Bangladesh.  JSW Cement which makes the environment friendlier Portland Slag Cement (PSC), a green cement, has for the past one year, been catering to requirements of its customers in the state as well as those in Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha from its Salboni unit. The company's plans to expand capacity in Salbon is thus indicative of the growth potential for green cement in the eastern region, a company official said.

The company is currently at 12.6 MT , after recently expanding its facility in Dolvi in Maharashtra to 2.2 MT, and it plans to take it to 20 MT, by a mix of brownfield expansion at all its facilities . Any inorganic opportunity will be considered once the company hits the IPO.  \"We have lots of opportunities in just brownfield expansion,\" Jindal told reporters on Tuesday.  \"We are evaluating stressed companies that are available.

The hike in the cement prices came after a \"protracted stall\" following the rollout of the goods and services tax in July 2017, said CRISIL Research in its report.  The increase would help the cement industry increase profitability and margins, it added.  \"The recent steep hikes in cement prices will boost the operating profitability of manufacturers even as costs are descending and demand growth ascending,\" the report said.

While other regions had a moderate increase, with Rs 26 in the west followed by Rs 12 in the east, Rs 7 in the central region, and Rs 4 per bag in the north, the report said.  \"This upends the downtrend in cement prices seen since the rollout of the GST ,\" it said.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Outsider in 'Birla house': New boss Harsh Vardhan Lodha has been the biggest change agent for the company</h1>", "description": "When 54,000 tonne of MP Birla cement was despatched from its seven pan-Indian units \u2014 the most in a single day for the century-old group \u2014 Sandip Ghosh could not help but feel vindicated. Along with his introvert boss Harsh Vardhan Lodha, the former Unilever and Lafarge executive and a clutch of professionals have been the biggest change agents for an empire that has braved generational changes, bereavements and a legal tumult over two decades, emerging reinvigorated.  It\u2019s been a trudge, sometimes downright frustrating. Blending legacies with agility and efficiency initiatives is always fraught with risks of disruption. Then there\u2019s the Rs 4,800-crore acquisition of Reliance Cements, which catapulted the flagship business into the top 8, bringing in premier brands, modern plants, access to raw material and an opportunity to expand.  \u201cWhen I came on board,\u201d quips Ghosh, executive director, Birla Corporation, \u201cI was seeking a good closing innings for my professional career. After three and a half years, I can smile (and look) back with satisfaction.\u201d No doubt, Ghosh has the last laugh, riding on a 1,314% jump in market cap over 10 years.   SCENE I  It\u2019s not too long ago that the clannish, conservative Marwari business community had given up on the MP Birla Group \u2014 cement, jute, cables, guar gum et al. In 1999, matriarch Priyamvada Birla courted sensation by bequeathing her husband\u2019s entire empire to her friend, consigliere and chartered accountant RS Lodha and his family. The fierce legal challenge from a unified Birla clan was inevitable. What was unfathomable was how a \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cfamily outsider\u201d would withstand it.  But the zealously private Harsh Vardhan, who took over after his father RS Lodha\u2019s death in 2008, thinks differently. Single-minded in focus and mandate, he says, \u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter. Our goal is to be the most profitable.\u201d It\u2019s typical Alex Ferguson management copybook from a diehard Manchester United fan. As a school friends puts it, \u201cDon\u2019t let his introverted self or baby face trick you. It completely belies his drive and dedication. He\u2019s a man out to prove himself.\u201d     Under Lodha\u2019s watch, even the lossmaking jute business at Birlapur, the first manufacturing unit of the entire Birla Group, has turned profitable and is diversifying into fashion, lifestyle and ecofriendly packaging.  The group\u2019s networth has more than doubled since 2004 to Rs 11,000 crore, including unlisted and investment companies. Over the last five years, listed flagship Birla Corp, which houses the largest business in the portfolio, has outperformed Nifty\u2019s 12% returns with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.20%. For the cables business, it is even more stark \u2014 an average of over 50%.  \u201cThe group has been growing from strength to strength,\u201d agrees Hemant Kanoria, chairman, Srei Group. \u201cProfitability is improving. Group companies are clocking growth.\u201d  The legal battles, claims and counter-claims of fraud, malfeasance and misconduct are still dragging on, but away from the kerfuffle, employees are revitalised and processes streamlined. Naturally, profitability has seen a big upswing.  \u201cI was very pleasantly surprised to see his (Lodha\u2019s) remarkable efforts and capabilities to provide leadership to Birla Corp and make it one of the fastest growing and successful enterprises from eastern India,\u201d adds namesake Harshavardhan Neotia, chairman, Ambuja Neotia Group, another corporate headquartered in Kolkata.   CEMENTING SUCCESS  There are three principal pillars to this change \u2014 people, marketing and operations. In a group that\u2019s always been proud of its matriarchal value systems, Lodha has had to imbibe change gradually. And nowhere is this more evident than the cement operations. Capacity has ramped up to 15.5 million tonnes per annum, from 10 mtpa, with plans to double it by 2025.  Unlike several of its peers that are battling post-merger integration challenges, Birla Corp has seamlessly integrated Reliance\u2019s operations within two years. It was actually an acquisition on a rebound, after its initial plans of buying two of Lafarge\u2019s units got stuck over transfer of mines.     \u201cIf we didn\u2019t buy, we would have been in trouble,\u201d admits Pracheta Majumdar, chief management adviser, Birla Corp. \u201cEarlier, even achieving 25,000 tonnes was a Herculean task. Our plants were old and strong brands almost nonexistent.\u201d Now, the group has the widest portfolio, with brands at all important price points \u2014 from super premium to regional champions, popular and even niche ones for non-trade channels.  The Reliance capacities are all running at 85%-plus while bigger competitors are struggling to scale up to 60% plant capacity. Of total volumes, 32% is premium grade, from nil only three years ago, while 87% is blended cement.  \u201cMP Birla\u2019s new management has become more aggressive,\u201d says Hari Mohan Bangur, managing director, Shree Cement, another community patriarch. \u201cThey are doing well in the market. Today, Birla Corp is an important name in the cement industry and has maintained its market share.\u201d  Riding piggyback, brand and services extensions such as chemicals and wall putty have also kicked off.  For the first time, an inhouse marketing team has been created to leverage the group\u2019s heritage and enhance the brand identity that is built on heart and strength. The former is exemplified through numerous schools and charitable hospital trusts, and the latter through cutting-edge joint ventures with premier MNCs \u2014 be it Ericsson, Solvay, ABB or Furukawa.  And though the history of alliances in India has been highly chequered, \u201cMP Birla always chose the best global partner for technical expertise and R&D. The culture of JVs permeated deeply,\u201d feels DR Bansal, a 53-year veteran, who has worked with all four chairmen, starting with MP Birla himself. \u201cThe goodwill is still intact under the leadership of the Lodhas .\u201d  Of course, a strong brand with a clear message is imperative, especially for businesses such as cables or cement. Most Birla factions have interests in cement and their brands often compete. Ghosh explains, \u201cFrom Orient Cement, to Birla A1 to Birla Gold or UltraTech, everyone is a Birla cement. It was sold as a commodity and people linked it to individual plants, which often ran as independent profit centres. It was critical to stand out.\u201d  MP Birla Cement brand didn\u2019t register, or even if it did, it was perceived as basic and low-brow. \u201cIn some markets, we were known as \u2018Ghoda Chhap\u2019 after Chetak, one of the heritage brands from Rajasthan. We had to undergo two levels of transition \u2014 at the group corporate level and through a harmonisation exercise to create defined brand architecture,\u201d Ghosh adds.  By clearly defining brand propositions, cross-selling and branding became possible. That, in turn, helped bottomline and production ramp-ups. As a cascading effect, even future talent acquisitions became easier.  \u201cWithin the mid-tier group of Prism, MyCem and others, Birla Corp\u2019s premiumisation efforts have paid off handsomely. It is 3x the volume of others and that is reflected in trade margins,\u201d says a Mumbai-based cement analyst not wishing to be identified.  Even in the larger Birla empire, barring the AV Birla Group, most are floundering. CK Birla\u2019s Orient clocked one of the worst results in the industry. BK Birla\u2019s Kesoram and Century Cements too are struggling. In perspective, MP Birla has indeed come back strongly after a long hiatus.   DIVERSIFIED ACHIEVEMENTS  The company\u2019s jute division has also improved after modernisation, including addition of a large number of new looms. From incurring a cash loss of Rs 13.03 crore in 2006-07, the division reached a cash profit of Rs 28.28 crore in 2017-18. In the December quarter of 2018-19, net jute sales grew 45.5% to Rs 95.6 crore. Ebidta, however, was subdued at RS 5.5 crore, largely due to surge in raw jute prices.  The listed trio of Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cables comprise the cables business, which is expected to be rejigged to simplify operations. From manufacturing a variety of capacitors, optic fibre, power and telecom cables to engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) contracts, the bet is 4G and, more importantly, the impending 5G revolution.  \u201cOver the next two to three years, we will be comfortable with our position as well as industry growth. To derisk and expand our cables business, we may look overseas,\u201d says Lodha.  This business too has withstood turbulence since the time Harsh got associated with the business as a 20-something professional in the early 1990s, when Priyamvada Birla, or \u2018Badi Ma,\u2019 took charge after her husband\u2019s death.     A disheartened senior management proposed a sell-off. \u201cBadi Ma\u2019s pragmatic business decision stopped the team from doing so,\u201d recalls Lodha. The extra high voltage and high voltage cables segments relied heavily on government expenditure for infrastructure and power sectors, which did not live up to promise. \u201cShe realised the cables business would take time to stabilise before it starts paying off and asked the team to focus on making the business competitive and profitable, rather than entering a blame game for the losses,\u201d he adds.  It paid off even as she took canny business decisions like shutting down the synthetics and carbide divisions, along with Bally Jute.  Lodha\u2019s keen interest in the business and aptitude in handling sensitive situations since 2008 brought him close to his core team, many having worked for decades. \u201cWhen he took over the reins, he was young and senior team members doubted his ability. Today, we have no doubts. Birla Furukawa has grown three times in fibre operations under him,\u201d admits old-timer Bansal. The change of guard was seamless.  At 50 years of age, audacity comes naturally to Harsh Vardhan Lodha. \u201cHe is one of the rare breed who has the DNA of both an entrepreneur and a professional. That way he can rely on his gut instinct, yet be risk averse. It\u2019s a perfect balance,\u201d says a Kolkata-based investment banker, who has worked with him closely over the years. \u201cSo he lets his board and management work independently, but during strategic calls, he effortlessly leads from the front.\u201d  Perhaps, counter-factually, if the inheritance had not accompanied such anguish, the Lodhas may have succumbed to cowboy bravado and perished. But with their every move under scrutiny, being sure-footed became second nature.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Industry divided over reason for rise in cement prices</h1>", "description": "As cement prices across India head north after displaying softness for over a year, consumer associations and infrastructure experts remain divided on the reason behind the increase: Supply controls or sustained revival in demand. A property-industry association in south India attributed the price increase to coordinated supply controls, an alleged monopolistic practice that has earlier drawn the attention of the federal competition panel.  \u201cThe companies are indulging in cartelisation, which is evident as the demand has also not dramatically gone up,\u201d said WS Habib, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), Chennai .  According to research reports, cement prices in February increased by Rs 24-25 per bag of 50 kg, but the increase was more pronounced in south India, where prices increased by more than Rs 60 per bag since January after manufacturers raised prices twice last month. Prices typically are soft in the peninsula through the winter months because the region receives northeast monsoons, preventing construction.  Mahendra Singhi, CEO of Dalmia Bharat and President of the Cement Manufacturers\u2019 Association (CMA), could not be immediately reached for his comments.  India is the world\u2019s second-biggest producing and consuming market for cement, and prices are determined largely by local logistical factors. Typically, cement sales correlate with broader economic growth by a factor of about 1.3 in India. If underlying demand remains muted, the current phase of higher pricing may not sustain beyond a couple of months, said some cement analysts. Infrastructure consultants, however, believe demand might be reviving, prompting companies to raise prices.

The growth in demand will be driven by a likely 18-20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of additional production capacity during the fiscal.  The domestic cement production rose by around 13 percent between April 2018 and February 2019 as compared to six percent year-on-year growth in FY18, the rating agency Icra said in its report.  \"For FY20, we expect a demand growth of eight per cent and given the limited capacity addition, this is likely to result in an improvement in the industry's utilisation to 71 percent in FY20 from 65 percent in FY18. Improved capacity utilization is likely to support the price uptick which has been seen since March 2019,\" Icra senior vice president Sabyasachi Majumdar said.  He further said around 18-20 MTPA of capacity is likely to get added in FY20.  \"However, a disproportionate part of the capacity addition is grinding opposed to clinker capacity. Thus, the actual production from new capacities could be lower. With the incremental demand of around 24-28 million tonne being greater than the incremental supply, this is likely to translate to improved capacity utilisation,\" Majumdar said.  Icra further noted that while in some regions such as north, north-east and east, the cement players' utilisation is likely to be higher than the national average, in other regions such as south and west, the utilisation is likely to remain muted given the past capacity overhang.  The agency pointed out that cement production remains healthy supported by the demand in south India, primarily in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana driven by irrigation, low cost housing and infrastructure projects and Tamil Nadu driven by infrastructure and rural housing.  Also, the strong growth in demand in eastern and western India, which is driven by low cost housing and infrastructure demand, in the north led by the execution of infrastructure projects and in central part of the country backed by rural housing, will boost cement production.  According to Icra, cement prices declined in most markets in FY19 in the range of 2.5-4.5 percent on a Y-o-Y basis.  In the Delhi and Kolkata markets, the average cement price was lower by Rs 10 per bag in FY19 on a Y-o-Y basis at Rs 290 per bag and Rs 283 per bag, respectively.  In Kolkata, the average price was lower by Rs 15 per bag at Rs 335 per bag in FY19.  The prices remained under pressure in August 2018 due to the monsoons, declining in most markets on an month-on- month basis. The prices were subdued during September 2018 February 2019.  \"The continued focus on the housing sector and rural economy in the Union Budget for 2019-20 is likely to have a positive impact on the cement industry. On the infrastructure side, the continued thrust on the roads and railways is likely to push cement demand. While the healthy demand is likely to support the recent price increase, the supply side pressure on prices in some regions cannot be ruled out completely,\" Majumdar added.

Link and Karvy executives are to meet Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) officials early this week to discuss the matter.  Sebi last week barred Sharepro, its promoters and directors from the capital markets and asked all companies to switch their activities to other registered share transfer agents after it found lapses.

ET NOW was the first to report the development. \"There is no provision under the Competition Act to entertain an alternative sale proposal once the terms and conditions of the original proposal have been finalized by the CCI.

This could lead to a change in management at the merged entity, which will be among the world\u2019s largest tower companies.  \u201cThe combined entity is being valued at $12-13 billion and once Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers merge, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group are aiming to bring their stakes down to around 13% each,\u201d a person with knowledge of the development told ET.  The merger of the tower companies, which has been in the making for about a year, is expected to come to fruition along these lines shortly, sources said.   KKR Could Hold up to 32%  After the merger, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, which currently own 42% each in Indus Towers, will hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively. KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel. Vodafone Idea, currently holding over 11% in Indus, is expected to exit at the time of merger.  \u201cPost merger, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group would reduce their stakes, by selling them primarily to KKR and a minority part to Canada Pension and some others,\u201d said a second person familiar with the negotiations.  KKR could eventually hold anywhere between 25% and 32% in the merged entity, which will have over 160,000 towers, with CPPIB and some others having minority stakes.    Both people said Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group are expected to retain a minimum of 13% at the beginning, allowing them certain rights such as veto powers over signing and terminating contracts with clients, among others. However, the Vodafone Group is expected to eventually exit the tower company.  The merger of Bharti Infratel, India\u2019s only listed tower company, and Indus Towers is set to come up for approval at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on May 14. \u201cThe stake sales in the new entity should conclude by June, when the merger is likely to close,\u201d the second person said.  Vodafone Group declined to comment on the matter, while Bharti Airtel and KKR didn\u2019t respond to emailed queries sent by ET.  If the merged entity is valued at $13 billion, Bharti Airtel could raise about $3.2 billion (Rs22,400 crore) by reducing its stake from over 37% to 13%. On its part, the Vodafone Group could raise around $2.1 billion by reducing its holding to 13% from over 29%.  Bharti Infratel closed 3.8% lower at Rs261.85 on the BSE on Tuesday, while Bharti Airtel ended 1.4% down at Rs320.20. Vodafone Idea fell 4.6% to Rs15.60.   CASH INFUSION  The stake sale is expected to generate much-needed cash for Bharti Airtel that will help strengthen its balance sheet, bolster its 4G network to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm and prepare for 5G. For Vodafone Group, it will be a return on some of its investment in India. It recently invested Rs 11,000 crore in Vodafone Idea\u2019s Rs25,000-crore rights issue.  Bharti Airtel, which had net debt of Rs 1.06 lakh crore at the end of December, is planning to raise Rs25,000 crore via its own rights issue, which opens on May 3. The company has raised Rs 27,800 crore in the last three years by selling stakes in Bharti Infratel, the direct-to-home (DTH) satellite TV unit, the Africa business and divesting towers in Africa and operations in two countries.  Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been under financial pressure since the entry of Jio over two years back, affecting revenue and driving their India mobile businesses into losses. Both have been raising cash through various means to pare debt and expand their 4G networks to take on Jio, which has almost caught up with them, both on revenue market share and subscriber numbers.

Edited excerpts:   How has the investment climate in India changed over the past few years?  In the past few years, we have invested tremendously in India. I think we have grown and multiplied investments by a factor of three to four. In terms of people, we have 3,600 where a couple of years ago, we were a couple of hundred. So it shows the momentum of India and the businessfriendliness in India is increasing. It is important not only for the Indian market because it is booming in this sector, but also as a global platform and we are exporting from India to places like Australia, Europe.   Do you plan to make India a leading supply base for your global market?  We had standard product ranges in India in the past, then we diversified into signalling, which is very important for India. The factory at Madhepura is the entry into mainline \u2013 the locomotive world. We are also now increasingly entering into infrastructure activities and we are implementing a project in the dedicated freight corridor, but all this infrastructure is helping meet the needs of the Middle East. So India is growing a full range of activities \u2013 from mainland to urban, infrastructure, services as well. So this is for the Indian market and worldwide.   What is driving so much activity from Alstom in India?  In our world of public transportation, urban transportation, we need to be very close to all our customers, to be locally based to better serve our customers. This is definitely the case in India. At the same time, we need to be competitive. So the huge Indian platform is also a strong enabler for global competitiveness and it\u2019s not only a question of cost but also of innovation. The urban transportation will require more and more digital technology in order to reach a greater level of efficiency.   What are your plans for Madhepura factory?  We have achieved this with some scepticism, to begin with. Now we need to go from producing a fantastic product to addressing the pollution problem. That will require heavy investment in Madhepura, but also, as importantly, a lot of investment in the supply chain. We want to develop a smooth supply chain in order to produce the remaining 799.   Can you put a timeline to it?  At full speed, we will deliver 100 per year, so on the whole it\u2019s a 10-year contract and then, of course, we have the full maintenance. Of course, we see it as a main challenge but we see also this factory as a beginning of an extremely long history. The need for locomotives is huge in India.   As part of global restructuring \u2013 Alstom\u2019s merger with Siemens \u2013 how does it change the India strategy given the financial stronghold of the merged entity?  The merger itself is here to speed up our strategy. So basically, the merger will allow us to be even closer to our customers and you can see this example in India where Siemens is also strong in terms of rail electrification. We need to think about our positioning and what we can bring to our customers in terms of global solutions, financing. We want to be the technological provider and the partner not only to the operator but to the railway authorities.   So does it translate into more investments along with new business models in India?  Absolutely! In terms of being the origin of engineering, everything will mechanically double in size, in terms of exports from India, in terms of engineering forces, etc. In addition, because of the changed business models, we need to invest more in India in terms of global solutions.   Indian Railways is investing a lot of money in upgrading its infrastructure and modernising it. What do you see as the major roadblocks?  We have this huge modernisation challenge and environmental challenge but in addition to that, you also have the safety challenge which comes into play. Environmental challenge is basically the electrification and its huge work to be done.   There is safety challenge, which requires huge level of investment in terms of signalling. Indian Railways is planning a signalling contract. What kind of business does it mean for Alstom?  Europe has been probably one of the pioneers of technology for signalling and similar to Europe, India has a high-density network, so I think there are some discussions around bringing the European technology to India and, of course, we will be more than happy to bring that. There are two elements \u2013 the pure technology, which is extremely important in the Indian context, but also it is an extremely ambitious project of management challenge because you need to install on mainline \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit more complex.   Are you looking at more JVs in India?  We are discussing setting up joint ventures with some of our suppliers in order to balance the approach. Today, we cannot name the players. We are encouraging international players like ABB to localise in India the products we need for supporting our project in Madhepura. This also indirectly brings a lot of investments, skills to the country.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Cement production may grow at 6-7% in FY19: Report</h1>", "description": "Cement production is expected to grow at 6-7 per cent in the current fiscal year, driven by pick-up in affordable and rural housing segments and infrastructure , a report said Wednesday.  However, rising costs are likely to put pressure on the operating profitability of cement firms in the coming quarters, Icra said in its report, adding the manufacturers' ability to secure price increases remains the key.  \"We expect cement demand growth of 6-7 per cent in FY2019, driven by a pick-up in the affordable and rural housing segments and infrastructure, primarily road and irrigation projects,\" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president, Icra.  According to the rating agency, cement production remained healthy in the first four months of FY19, reporting a 14.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth.  Production remained in the range of 27.5-28.6 million tonne (mt) during the April-June period, clocking the highest at 28.6 mt in June. It declined in July by 9.3 per cent on a month-on-month (MoM) basis owing to the monsoons, when cement consumption is on the lower side. However, it remained high by 10.8 per cent on a YoY basis, at close to 26 mt, it said.  The trend was supported by demand, driven primarily by low-cost housing (in south - AP and Telangana; and in the east - except Bihar ) and a pick-up in the execution of infrastructure projects (in south - AP and Telangana and in the eastern and western regions), the report said.  On the capacity side, Icra estimates that around 17-19 mtpa will get added in FY19-20, primarily in the east and central regions. However, the actual production from new capacities could be lower, given that a disproportionate part of the capacity addition is largely grinding as opposed to clinker capacities, it said.  While the additions have moderated, the agency expects that the capacity overhang is likely to continue to keep the industry's capacity utilisation level below 70 per cent, over the next two years.  Lumpy capacity additions in the recent past have led to an increase in debt levels and some deterioration in credit metrics, although they still remain at comfortable levels for most of the larger players, according to the report.  While in the north and south, the prices are on the lower side by Rs 25-30 per bag, the prices in the east are largely similar in the first five months of FY19 (YoY).  Icra said the pressure on prices will continue in the second quarter of FY19, owing to the monsoons, which have an adverse impact on cement demand.  Hence, the higher power, fuel cost due to increase in coal and pet coke prices and freight costs owing to increase in diesel prices in the first half of FY19 and in the coming quarters are likely to continue to pressure profitability margins and debt metrics of cement companies in the near term, according to the report.  \"Hence, the players' ability to secure increases in cement prices remains critical from a profitability perspective,\" said Majumdar.

Jha told the House of Commons Business Select Committee that structural disadvantages in the UK, such as extremely high energy costs, were largely the reason for the crisis in the steel industry. \"There is no dead drop time that has been given, though you will appreciate with the kind of losses that there are, urgency is important. What if no buyer emerges? We cannot continue to bleed,\" Jha said. \"We have seen over a period of time that manufacturing in Britain has been on a decline. If we were at the same electricity costs as Germany, then (Tata Steel UK) would be 40 million pounds better off - we would not be having negative numbers. We would not be selling the business if we were not losing money,\" he added. He also clarified that the company did not want to split up its UK business by selling it to different buyers. Jha warned that splitting off Port Talbot in south Wales would cause damage to the pension scheme because more than 4,000 workers would stop making contributions. \"We would not deal with somebody saying leave alone Port Talbot and give us the rest. That is not a solution that's acceptable,\" Jha explained. He warned the MPs that the company's 15 billion pounds pension liability needed to be addressed to help find a buyer. The UK government has said it is looking at the pension scheme, which any buyer would have to inherit, to see if it could be separated from the business. \"If we don't solve it [pensions], we are staring at some very bad consequences for the taxpayer...We are staring at a huge economic and social disaster,\" Jha warned. The pension fund has more than 130,000 members and a deficit of around 485 million pounds. UK business secretary Sajid Javid told the committee that pension fund trustees were in talks with the pensions regulator. He reiterated that the UK government would not take a stake of more than 25 per cent in Tata Steel's UK assets. \"Twenty five per cent was the limit that I thought was necessary to show that on the one hand you're serious about helping...but also not to put off potential investors by saying this is something the government seeks to control,\" he said, adding that the government was keen to secure the sale of Tata Steel's UK units soon. Javid admitted that \"with the benefit of hindsight\" he should have gone to Mumbai in late March for a Tata board meeting which concluded it should sell its UK business, rather travel to Australia on a business trip with his daughter.

The unlisted firm, which makes forged and rolled rings for all types of bearings, posted Rs 1 crore loss on Rs 160 crore revenues in 2006-07, is emerging as a turnaround case. Sources said the deal may be announced within a few weeks. A senior NSR official confirmed that the company had signed a term sheet with the company. \u201cThe company has got certain growth trajectory. Our investment is based on the company\u2019s future prospects,\u201d said the official. The company is expected to clock in around 100% growth in revenues to over Rs 300 crore, and post Rs 70 crore operating profit (EBITA or earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation) and Rs 25 crore net profit. It is currently rolling out a Rs 250-crore expansion plan. \u201cPE funds are no longer demanding excellent past performance as a pre-requisite for infusing funds. They are now looking for companies with future prospects rather than their performance record,\u201d said a leading PE official.

Everstone Capital, which owns the Mumbai-based Rubicon, will sell its 70% stake while there would be primary capital infusion into the company. The exact quantum of stake sale is yet to be ascertained.  The acquisition would mark General Atlantic 's renewed focus on pharma, the buyout major having backed Jubilant Lifesciences in the past.  Sameer Sain, Co-Founder and CEO of Everstone Group, confirmed the exit from Rubicon and highlighted the \u201cstrong relationship and true team work between internal and external stakeholders\u201d that helped produce \u201cexceptional outcomes.\u201d On his part, Parag Sancheti , Director, Rubicon Research, thanked Everstone for underpinning growth at the CRAMS major.  A spokesperson at General Atlantic declined to comment.  According to a 2016 statement, the Everstone Group had bought a controlling stake stake in Rubicon Research for Rs 220 crore ($33 million). Through the sale of the three-year-old investment, Everstone Capital Partners III will generate a 4.5x multiple and a 92% IRR (internal rate of return) in one of the best exits in the pharmaceutical industry.  Founded by Pratibha Pilgaonkar, Rubicon is a specialty generics pharmaceutical product-development company engaged in research, development and manufacturing of branded and specialty generic products and OTC products. Everstone's investment in 2016, with primary and secondary components, also provided an exit to Kotak Private Equity, an early investor in Rubicon.  Founded in 1999, Rubicon operates out of three locations, corporate HQ and R&D center based in Thane, Mumbai; USFDA & UK MHRA inspected manufacturing facility based out of Ambernath, Mumbai, and a marketing office in Plainsboro, the US. Rubicon offers a range of services such as formulation development, analytical research development, technology transfer, regulatory support and clinical trial supplies.  According to RoC data, Rubicon reported revenue of Rs 65 crore in 2017-18, compared with Rs 49 crore in the previous year. It has total debt of Rs 29 crore as on 31 March 2018.  Due to low manpower costs, India has an edge in the CRAMS space where global pharmaceutical giants outsource drug research and development to reduce costs. By offering high-end research and complex technology services and ensuring the availability of a significant pool of professionals, India remains the preferred destination globally for outsourcing drug development.  Globally, General Atlantic has companies such as Ginkgo Network, OneOncology, Citius Tech, Oak Street Health, and Evicore Healthcare in its investment portfolio. Rubicon will be its second pure-play pharma bet in India.  General Atlantic, among the first global funds to set up a base in India, has successfully backed several home-grown consumer, fintech and financial services firms such as Anita Dongre, PNB Housing, IIFL Wealth, Byju's, and Mu Sigma. It has traditionally been active in the healthcare space, backing hospital chains both in India and elsewhere in Asia. Sources said the fund was scouting for a pharma platform for some time.  Everstone, which manages assets in excess of $5 billion across private equity, real estate, infrastructure and venture capital, has a broad exposure to the pharma and healthcare sectors.  In 2015, Everstone had made another successful exit in the healthcare space after it sold its stake in Global Hospitals to Malaysia-based IHH Healthcare, generating returns in excess of three times the original investment.  Everstone also owns a controlling stake in domestic pharma distribution platform, Ascent Health, and SouthEast Asia-based diagnostic device platform Everlife. It is also an investor in OmniActive, one of the largest nutraceutical ingredient businesses.  ET had reported last month about Everstone's interest in acquiring a majority stake in Sahyadri Hospitals Ltd - the largest chain of hospitals in Maharashtra.

Sanctum is a city-based company that will be led by Shiv Gupta , who heads the private banking business, and the existing management team. The deal comprises transfer of client relationships and staff, it added. Existing branches in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bengaluru will also be retained by Sanctum, it said, adding it hopes to conclude the deal by March. RBS country executive Brijesh Mehra said: \"We gave careful consideration in identifying a buyer that would minimise the impact to clients and staff and is committed to building on the investments made in the private banking franchise.\" \"We look forward to leveraging the strong foundation of the existing private banking business and taking it to further heights, through investments in people, technology, products and partnerships,\" Gupta said. There was speculation of a management buyout at the wealth management arm of RBS. The arm reportedly has USD 2.5 billion of assets under management.

The infrastructure finance company is exploring a sale of its oil storage terminal located in the emirate of Fujairah . The terminal provides storage facilities for oil and petrochemical products originating from energy giant BP\u2019s facilities in Qatar.  The terminal has a storage capacity of 600,000 cubic meters and was in the process of expanding its capacity further but has now been tagged as a \u201cnon-core\u201d asset, people directly familiar with the matter said.  The proposed sale could attract interest from Abu Dhabi state-owned investment company Mubadala and global ports and terminals operator DP World as well as certain infrastructure-focused private equity funds.  The terminal\u2019s operations have suffered after the UAE imposed a blockade on vessels originating from Qatar preventing them from offloading supplies at the port of Fujairah. The blockade is among a series of measures that UAE, Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Bahrain have taken after they severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on charges that the gas-rich state was sponsoring terrorism and increasing its proximity with Iran.  IL&FS expects the terminal to fetch a price of Rs 1000 crore. The terminal is owned by IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure, a whollyowned subsidiary of the company.  Saibal De, IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure\u2019s CEO, declined comment when contacted by ET. Almost 90% of the terminal\u2019s current capacity is allocated for storage of BP\u2019s supplies and a buyer will likely have to negotiate new contracts or wait for restrictions to ease once normal diplomatic relations between the feuding states resume. \"There are concerns about political stability in the middle east region. The risk is considered much higher as the diplomatic standoff has continued for months. This is already impacting interest rates and bank lending rates for assets are moving up due to the perception of heightened country risk\", said Abhishek Poddar, Partner, Asia Pacific at AT Kearney.  The initial phase of the terminal\u2019s construction was funded by a loan from a consortium of four banks including ICICI Bank, EXIM Bank, Bank of Baroda and National Bank of Fujairah. The disruption in the terminal\u2019s operations could lead to delays in servicing of the $90 million loan, aware of the matter said.  IL&FS has been shedding non-core assets in an effort to trim its balance sheet and reduce debt. It also plans to limit its ownership of infrastructure assets to India.  ET had reported in its edition dated March 22 that it had kickstarted a process to divest its interest in a joint venture with China\u2019s Chongqing Expressway Group, an investment that was made five years ago and marked the first major infrastructure investment by an Indian company in China.  It has also divested its trust and fiduciary services business and sold its derivatives clearing and settlement arm in the past 18 months.  The company reported consolidated revenues of Rs 17,156 crore for the year to March 2017, logging a 14% growth in revenues year-on-year.  IL&FS is a core investment company and has eight operating subsidiaries. Its businesses span development and financing of large scale urban infrastructure projects. It also has interests in ports, water and waste management as well as an education business.  The company plans to participate in an auction of toll-operate-transfer projects being planned by the National Highways Authority of India.  Its maritime infrastructure arm owns a stake in Dighi Port in the Raigad district of Maharashtra and also has a construction contract to build a port in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu situated near a 3600 MW thermal power project owned by IL&FS.", "published_date": "Nov 02, 2017, 10.24 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:57:20", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ilfs-to-sell-fujairah-oil-terminal-as-prospects-wane/articleshow/61426377.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">UK high court orders British Steel into liquidation</h1>", "description": "KOLKATA: The UK high court on Wednesday ordered British Steel, the UK's second largest steel producer into compulsory liquidation. A report by S&P Global Platts on Thursday said according to a statement from the government's Insolvency Service, adding that the company will continue to trade and supply its customers while the Official Receiver considers options for the business.  The development follows the company's failure to secure emergency government funding. With this, some 5,000 direct jobs and another estimated 20,000 indirect jobs are now at stake. Owned by investment firm Greybull Capital, British Steel, has around 3 million tonne/year of steel capacity across its main site at Scunthorpe in the UK, in France and the Netherlands. Incidentally, Greybull Capital had bought the assets from former owners, Tata Steel for a nominal sum of one GBP in 2016. It was subsequently named as British Steel.   The company had been asking for support from the UK government for the last few weeks and as late as on Tuesday the government had said it would leave \"no stone unturned\" in its support of the domestic steel industry, the Platts report added.  British Steel confirmed a few days ago that it was in talks with ministers about \u201ca package of additional support,\u201d blaming the situation on uncertainty caused by Brexit . The value of that loan has not been disclosed but the GMB union has said it could be as much as GBP75 million ($96.8 million).  The government had already granted a GBP120 million loan earlier this month to help British Steel cover carbon market costs linked to Brexit.  \"This news is a significant blow for the company, its employees, and the communities across the UK that it supports. British Steel does not sit in isolation but is a critical part of the UK\u2019s wider steel sector, a strategic British industry underpinning a myriad of supply chains,\u201d the report quoted Gareth Stace, Director General of UK Steel, an industry association as saying.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">My career would have gone differently if I were a man: Biologist Gagandeep Kang</h1>", "description": "Biologist Gagandeep Kang is the first Indian woman to be elected as a fellow of the Royal Society , London. A professor at Christian Medical College , Vellore, and executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Kang has been working on diarrhoeal diseases for close to three decades and has helped develop Rotavac , India\u2019s first indigenous vaccine against the rotavirus that causes severe diarrhoea and is responsible for the death of 80,000-100,000 children in the country every year.  Kang, 57, hopes that there will be many more Indian women as fellows of the Royal Society so that her distinction will soon get erased. In an interview with ET, Kang talks about the pioneering study she is currently engaged in, the state of research in India and how gender and hierarchical impediments have slowed her career by at least six years. Edited excerpts:    How did you get drawn to research, especially after an MBBS?  I had done my MD in microbiology, so it was a question of doing the same thing day in and day out. I had gone into it thinking it had a more clinical angle but in most microbiology labs in India, it\u2019s very much benchwork. I thought I should get into a place where I have different challenges every day so I went into research groups at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, and stayed there.   What drew your attention to the rotavirus?  It was largely by accident. When I began research in microbiology as a faculty member, whatever I worked on, people who were already established would tell me it was their turf. As I was at a junior level in a research unit, I had no option but to back off. One area that no one was interested in was diarrhoeal disease \u2014 everyone else was studying much more glamorous things. So I said I\u2019d study diarrhoea. And in diarrhoea no one was studying viral gastroenteritis because it\u2019s much harder to do than bacteria. So I was allowed to work on that, and that\u2019s how I got interested in the rotavirus.   Rotavac, the rotavirus vaccine that you helped develop, is an oral vaccine. Oral vaccines have been less effective in developing countries like India. What has your research shown about the reasons for it?  We have been part of an eight-country study for about 10 years. We actually don\u2019t have an explanation. Despite everything we have tried to do, there is no one thing you can pin down as the cause. There are a number of things that seem to overall affect how children grow, how their gut functions, how they make immune responses to vaccines...   So what is the current efficacy of oral vaccines in India?  Ah\u2026 good question. When vaccines are tested in clinical trials, you test the efficacy of a vaccine in a Phase-3 study. But efficacy studies are very tightly controlled \u2014 you get some sense of how the vaccine works, but it\u2019s not the realworld setting. If you want to study the real impact of the vaccine, you have to study it after it is within the immune system. So far, in India, we have never done an impact assessment of a newly introduced vaccine. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing at the moment \u2014 a large-scale safety and effectiveness study of the Rotavac, with the idea of measuring impact. I\u2019ll have the data early next year. It\u2019s the first time this is being done in the country.   It is often pointed out that just 0.6% of GDP is spent on research in India. Is the lack of funding one of the main reasons constricting the quality of research in the country?  It\u2019s both the amount of funding and the timing of funding. If you want big, impactful studies, you can\u2019t do them with a three-year grant cycle. You need to not only fund big, you also need to fund long. And that Indian funding agencies tend not to do. It\u2019s usually the \u2018spray and pray\u2019 approach \u2014 you sprinkle funding around and hope that something comes out of it.   Coming to your latest achievement, what does it mean for you to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society \u2014 as an Indian scientist and as the first Indian woman?  As an Indian scientist, there have been 60 fellows of the Royal Society, including three or four in medical research, so I\u2019m not that unusual. On being the first Indian woman, well, it\u2019s a nice landmark, but I hope there will be lots more after me so that this gets erased very quickly.   Were there instances in your career when you felt things might have gone differently if you were a man?  Lots of times. In every career, for women, both hierarchy and gender play against what you want to do. I\u2019ve been trying to quantify this of late \u2014 what it would have meant, if I didn\u2019t have these kinds of impediments. And I think, in my 28-year career, I\u2019m about six years behind \u2014 which I wouldn\u2019t have been without those impediments.   Did you have women mentors, and did that make a difference?  Yes, but not in India. And they made an amazing difference. The Indian system is such that you are deeply grateful if you get five minutes with somebody and eternally grateful if they give you good advice. When I first went to the UK, I realised that mentoring is a part of their culture \u2014 it\u2019s a two-way street, where there\u2019s as much expectation of a mentor as there is of somebody who\u2019s coming up the system. These are measured and evaluated. If it becomes part of your role to support young people and you are measured for that, you would probably do a better job. Right now, it\u2019s almost a favour. A lot of these so-called guides treat their PhD students as labour in the lab, not thinking that they are in the way of someone\u2019s career.   What would you tell youngsters, especially young girls, who are thinking of a career in research?  Curiosity is a good thing. You have to have a passion for whatever you do. And don\u2019t give up. The thing with science is you are bound to fail. And you are bound to fail again and again and again. But it\u2019s really worth doing because when you do find out something that is new, it\u2019s also usually important.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Missing wombs: The health scandal enslaving families in rural India</h1>", "description": "By Roli Srivastava   KARAULI, INDIA: Farm labourer Dharmendra Meena's first year of marriage with his wife Vaijanti in northwest India was \"beautiful and carefree\".  But their first pregnancy changed everything.  First came the infection during childbirth, then the stark choice presented by a visiting doctor: undergo a \"life-saving\" hysterectomy - the removal of her uterus and ovaries - or die.  The couple took a loan of 100,000 rupees ($1,400) to cover the procedure, trapping Dharmendra in slave labour and joining thousands of people in rural India estimated to have been duped by unscrupulous doctors into having unnecessary hysterectomies.  A Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation found many women - often young - targeted by doctors whom medical experts say seek to profit by prescribing the surgery for minor ailments, with the operation and later costs driving families into debt.  Having a hysterectomy brought on the menopause for Vaijanti, also a farm labourer, then aged 19, while Dharmendra was forced to work on the money lender's farm for long hours and low pay as he tried to clear his debt - becoming a victim of debt bondage .  He ended up having to do other jobs and take more loans to support his wife and child, and now - seven years after the surgery - earns less than the monthly interest of 6,000 rupees.  \"The interest on the loan is rising every month,\" Dharmendra told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting in a sparse hut next to his wife in Taroli, a village in the state of Rajasthan.  \"We don't sleep any more. We fear the money lender,\" he said before Vaijanti listed their losses - the wedding jewellery they sold, her fertility, his freedom and their hopes for the future.   SEEKING A SOLUTION  About 3 percent of Indian women have had the surgery, found a landmark survey in 2018 by the government, which is trying to improve medical standards and reduce malpractice after media reports and a lawsuit drew attention to hysterectomy scams.  The cost of hysterectomies driving families into slavery has largely gone under the radar, human rights activists said.  The Indian Council of Medical Research is writing guidelines for hysterectomies, and the health ministry plans to publish a standard operating procedure for gynaecologists to follow.  But Dinesh Baswal, deputy commissioner of maternal health in the health ministry, said it was a complex problem as women sought hysterectomies thinking that it would help resolve abnormal bleeding or painful periods that stopped them working.  \"A majority of cases can be handled with the assurance that it will go on its own,\" Baswal said. \"But how do you counsel them? They keep going back to the doctor for a solution.\"  Medical experts and health campaigners said they were concerned action was too slow with India overlooking the financial distress and bonded labour involved post-surgery.  The popularity of hysterectomies was once attributed to its coverage by state health insurance schemes for the poor. But the surgery has continued after many states removed the cover due to reports of hospitals carrying out the procedure to claim funds.  In visits to about a dozen villages in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana states over five months, the Thomson Reuters Foundation found hysterectomies were routinely leaving families destitute and trapping people in modern-day slavery.  Interviews with 38 women who said they were struggling financially post-surgery uncovered 10 cases of debt bondage, with families selling jewellery, livestock and land to survive.  In most cases, their husbands or sons had no choice but to toil for the money lender, who used the debt as leverage to compel them to work without any contract, rights or recourse.  The families reported the surgery costing between 30,000 and 100,000 rupees, but many ended up paying more for post-procedure problems. With many women unable to return to work, families' incomes were halved, increasing their dependence on loans.   \"WAR ON WOMEN\"  India is home to an estimated 8 million modern-day slaves, working at farms, factories and fisheries, trapped in the sex trade or forced into marriages, according to the Global Slavery Index by the Australia-based charity Walk Free Foundation .  While factors ranging from India's caste system to rural-urban migration or drought and deforestation are often cited as causing debt bondage, the financial impact of hysterectomies has received little attention, human rights campaigners say.  In a first step to map the problem after years of activism on the medical malpractice, the government last year released data on the number of women who had undergone the procedure.  Various states from Telangana to Chhattisgarh have in the past decade cracked down on small private clinics that performed the surgery frequently to claim state health insurance funds.  But India has not grasped the scale of how many unnecessary hysterectomies are being performed nationwide, according to activists who said the 2018 survey was only a small first step.  More than 22,000 Indian women aged 15 to 49 out of 700,000 surveyed - 3 percent - had undergone a hysterectomy, it found.  Half of the women had never gone to school and two-thirds of surgeries were performed in private hospitals, the data showed.  Campaigners fear without a crackdown on unscrupulous clinics across rural India, the practice will continue to endanger women's health and trap families in debt bondage.  Some medical studies have linked hysterectomies to early onset of osteoporosis and other serious health side effects.  \"This has to be recognised as a cause of indebtedness and bonded labour,\" said Bharath Bhushan, founder of Centre for Action Research and People's Development (CARPED) - one of the first organisations to study the medical malpractice in 2005.  \"This (a hysterectomy) is a big expense for poor families, and it leads to loss of wages as the women are unable to work post-surgery,\" Bhushan said. \"They have lost their health, and livelihood. This is crazy ... this is war on a woman's body.\"   BONDED  Over the last decade, activists have recorded thousands of hysterectomies in villages in Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Odisha, among other states.  Deepali Laute was 21 when she had a hysterectomy after being told she could die of her abdominal pain. Laute was a mother of two and the doctor said she no longer needed her uterus anyway.  As farm workers in Budhiyad village in Maharashtra, Laute and her husband earned 200 rupees daily. They took a loan of 20,000 rupees from their boss that trapped them in debt bondage.  Three years later, she is still recovering from the surgery and cannot work, while her husband Dashrath repays the loan by spending longer hours on his employer's farm for far less money.  \"We were always poor, but I never had a loan on my head,\" said Dashrath. While he earns about 250 rupees for a day's work, the loan repayment leaves him with only 50 rupees to take home.  \"My loan is constantly increasing as I keep borrowing more for recurring medical expenses. Deepali is still not well.\"  Despite their strife, the couple do not regret the surgery.  \"The doctor said I will die if I don't get my womb removed. I feel a lot of pain after the surgery in my limbs, but at least I am alive,\" said Laute, feeding goats tied outside her tin shed home in the middle of a pomegranate farm as dusk drew nearer.  Baswal, from the health ministry, said various states have started requiring doctors to gain government approval to perform a hysterectomy - to curb unnecessary surgery and fraudulent claims for money.  But now people pay for the procedure themselves and move to nearby villages or far-off towns to repay the debt, said Archana Kharche of Astitva, a Maharashtra-based women's rights charity that has the mapped the malpractice in 20 villages in the area.  About 400 km (245 miles) east of Budhiyad is Mohammed Nagar village in Telangana state, where generations have undergone the procedure as doctors in the area defy sporadic state crackdowns.  Telangana has the highest number of hysterectomies in India - government data shows - with Maloth Bhuti among those who believed the surgery was her best shot at curing period pains.  The surgery halved her family income as Bhuti, whose mother and daughter-in-law are among 50 women in the village to have undergone the procedure, was unable to return to her farm work.  \"I can no longer work. My children take care of me. My husband had to leave the village to work on the money lender's farm. He had no choice,\" said Bhuti, 45, a mother-of-four.  Telangana health director G. Srinivas Rao said the state was informing women in villages of the health risks of the surgery.  \"We have also asked hospitals to fill out details of each hysterectomy case, which is then audited by health officials. There is some change,\" said Rao, a doctor.   \"UNNECESSARY AND UNETHICAL\"  In Dausa, Rajasthan, advocate Durga Prasad Saini recalled how he started tracking hysterectomies in five private hospitals in the neighbouring town of Bandikui almost a decade ago.  \"We were discussing the problem of female foeticide, when someone said: 'But where are the wombs?',\" he said.  \"Nearly 80 percent of all procedures carried out were hysterectomies. We counted 1,000 hysterectomies in a year in the five (private) hospitals,\" he said.  His findings formed part of a petition filed in 2013 against the practice in the Supreme Court by physician-campaigner Narendra Gupta, founder of non-profit Prayas based in Rajasthan, who sought compensation for the women who had the surgery.  The petition - which is still pending in India's top court - and subsequent requests to officials prompted the government to carry out the first-ever national hysterectomy survey, he said.  Rural women often do not get a proper consultation at state hospitals so they go to private doctors, where they are advised to undergo \"unnecessary and unethical\" hysterectomies, he added.  \"There are enough studies and reports that show clearly that there is a rising number of hysterectomies,\" Gupta said.  \"A lot ... are being conducted without other non-invasive methods being explored.\"  While hysterectomies in the West are common post-menopause, activists say many rural Indians are having the surgery young -after being told it offers a quick fix to their period problems.  Some doctors say they offer the surgery based on demand.  \"Women think if the uterus is removed, they will be free of (period pains),\" said C.K. Sharma, a doctor who runs a hospital in Karauli, which is popular with women in nearby villages.  \"If I say no (for a hysterectomy), they will go to another doctor to get it removed,\" said Sharma, who declined to give his full name and did not respond to further requests for comment.  DESPERATE FOR THE DOCTOR  Hysterectomies, medical experts say, are never the solution to the problems that women present to doctors, and its demand highlights the issue of private doctors cashing in on ignorance.  \"Doctors link all of it - their pelvic pain or lower back pain - to the uterus,\" said Subha Sri, the head of Commonhealth - a Chennai-based coalition of health charities.  Subha Sri reviewed hysterectomy cases in southern Karnataka state and said the procedure - which should be carried out only in rare cases - was being arbitrarily done by doctors.  \"They are introducing health problems and often not treating women for what they had come for,\" she said.  Couples such as Dharmendra Meena and Vaijanti said they felt they had no option but to opt for surgery that was presented as a life-or-death choice at a desperate time.  But Vaijanti often wonders about what could have been.  \"I could have continued working on the farm if I hadn't had the surgery. I would have had another child,\" the 26-year-old said. \"The surgery changed everything.\" ", "published_date": "May 08, 2019, 11.13 AM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:57:22", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/missing-wombs-the-health-scandal-enslaving-families-in-rural-india/articleshow/69229144.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

Aster Easy Care has been developed in association with Bajaj Fin Serve and Federal Bank to provide patient funding which can be repaid in monthly instalments (EMIs) over a period of one year. The interest cost of the loan is borne by Aster DM Healthcare.  Speaking about the initiative, Dr. Azad Moopen, founder chairman and managing director of Aster DM Healthcare said, \u201cAster Financial Service Centre is launched to take care of the financial requirements of needy patients who struggle when a large amount for treatment is required. The AFSC is a single window, a hassle-free service being introduced for the first time in India. The philosophy behind starting this is to make sure that a patient who is coming to our hospitals must be treated if there is a bed or investigation slot available, through the various services offered through the centre.\u201d  There are authentic crowd funding platforms with whom Aster DM Healthcare has been working with, in the last five years like the Milaap, Impact Guru etc. ,to meet the needs of people who can't afford. The ease with which many deserving patients have got a significant amount through crowd funding on internet opens up an avenue for poor and needy patients to get their genuine requirement for funding being met.  Explaining the module and process of work, Dr Harish Pillai, CEO- Aster Hospitals & Clinics, India said, \u201cOnce their financial requirement is established, the family of the patient or the patient themselves will be guided to a bouquet of unique services on offer ranging from interest free loans to innovative crowd funding options.\u201d ", "published_date": "May 08, 2019, 05.22 PM IST", "created_data": "2019-05-23 15:57:23", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/aster-starts-finance-service-centres-in-its-hospitals-to-help-patients/articleshow/69235600.cms", "source": "ecospd"},

General Atlantic and ICICI Venture did not respond to ET queries.  ICICI Venture had invested about Rs 220 crore in 2014 in the hospital chain, which had around 500 beds.  It helped expand and was waiting to exit through a public offer this year. KIMS, which received the SEBI approval for a public offer, had to put its share sale plan on hold due to regulatory changes and pricing uncertainty.  In its prospectus, KIMS had listed regulatory challenges as one having likely \u201cadverse impacts\u201d on the business. \u201cReforms in the health care industry and the uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and related matters could adversely affect its business and results of operations,\u2019\u2019 the company said in its public offer document filed with the regulator.    Hospital chains have been expanding their businesses, with government sponsored insurance coverage driving future growth.  \u201cWe foresee sector revenues growing at a strong 15% annually over the next three fiscals (2018-20), led by rapid expansion in health insurance coverage through government-sponsored schemes,\u2019\u2019 rating agency Crisil had said in a report released in December 2017. \u201cThe number of people covered by health insurance has nearly doubled to 42 crore in the past three fiscals and the government remains focused on enhancing access to affordable healthcare.\u2019\u2019 The ratings agency expects large corporate chains, with more than Rs 400 crore in revenue to increase capacity by 25% between FY2018 and 2019 through investments of Rs 5,000 crore.  \u201cHigher volume growth, primarily from a larger aging population, urbanisation, rising affordability of private healthcare services, and steadily increasing bed capacity in under-penetrated areas are helping draw local business houses, foreign PE funds and hospital chains to acquire existing hospital services companies,\u201d says a Goldman Sachs report.  Malaysia\u2019s sovereign fund Khazana-backed IHH (Asia\u2019s biggest hospital chain), American private equity fund TPG Capital-backed Manipal Hospitals, and a consortium of billionaires led by Sunil Munjal and the Burman family of Dabur have bid aggressively for Fortis Healthcare, which has been put on the block.  ET reported in April that Max Healthcare owner and billionaire Analjit Singh is in talks to purchase the South African partner Life Healthcare Group Holdings\u2019 47.5% stake in hospital chain Max Healthcare for $450-540 million.  \u201cIndia hospitals offer higher growth, but at lower return ratios than other Asia hospitals,\u201d brokerage Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note in February this year.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"clearfix title\">Home caregiving thrives but talent needs to keep pace</h1>", "description": "Ekvira Bada, a 25-year-old, UAE based NRI, has lost count of the number of caretakers she\u2019s had to cycle through ever since her grandmother in Mumbai suffered a fall in 2015. She says the number is anywhere between 20 and 25.  \u201cOnce, we got a lady who was incredibly rude and would shout at granny if she wanted assistance at night,\u201d says Bada. The person had been brought on for night duty, \u201cbut all she wanted to do was sleep.\u201d Although Bada or her younger sister has stayed with the grandmother, now 86, ever since she suffered the fracture, they still needed someone else to take care of her 24x7. Nuclear urban families without the time and support system to take care of ailing parents, the rising cost of hospital care and the growing prevalence of lifestyle diseases are contributing to the trend of homecare.  ET spoke to officials from more than a dozen hospitals, diagnostic chains and healthcare startups, who said they are recruiting highly skilled healthcare workers including nurses, lab technicians and pharmacists and starting services in new cities. Getting enough trained people, though, is proving to be a problem.  Companies said attrition was high among nurses, many of whom aspire to go abroad and therefore prefer to work in hospitals, which is seen as more valuable experience. Lack of accredited training institutions also contributes to the shortage of personnel, said Rituparna Chakraborty, executive vice-president of TeamLease Services, a staffing firm. The home healthcare market is set to hit $6.21 billion (Rs 43,00 crore) next year, according to 2016 estimates by Cyber Media Research.    Old-age homes are not always preferred because of the high cost of admission and poor conditions. Shailesh Yadav, a US-based software engineer, says he had considered putting his mother in an old-age home, but once the home got to know he was an NRI, they started asking for exorbitant fees.  UAE-based Bada says oldage homes in India aren\u2019t equipped to deal with complex medical conditions. For her, putting someone in an old-age home is akin to abandoning them. \u201cImagine how granny would feel. Unwanted and scared,\u201d she says. Smaller mom-and-pop \u201cbureaus,\u201d as they are known, have been operating in the market for longer, but startups including Portea, Our Home Healthcare and Care24 have brought in greater professionalisation and accountability. They are now taking their gloves off and ramping up hiring, although finding and retaining talent is a problem.  Portea, started in 2013, will focus on its medical solution-based offerings and doctor partnerships, says Meena Ganesh, managing director. South India-based homecare startups Nightingales and Our Home Healthcare will expand in the north, according to CEO Narasimha Jayakumar and managing director V Thiagarajan of the respective firms. Prateep Sen, founder of Kolkata-based Tribeca Care, says that he could absorb 500 to 1,000 nurses in the coming year, but doubted he would find enough talent.  Care24 founder Vipin Pathak says caregiving is not the most preferred of careers because the usually low pay by smaller bureaus, absence of career growth and lack of respect from patients\u2019 families were obstacles. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job, right?\u201d says Pathak. He says that while patients were given more leeway in terms of behaviour, they could be blacklisted as customers if their family members behaved inappropriately.  There are also risks associated with personal and medical safety and what to do in emergencies, especially for non-medical caregivers. Pathak says the company has training modules that could take between a week to two months to cover these aspects. Hospital chains have got into the game late but are expanding the services offered.  Apollo\u2019s home-nursing segment has grown 25-30% and its home diagnostics segment has expanded 30% annually for the past two years, said a spokesperson. Max@home, the home healthcare division of Max Hospitals, will start providing dental services this year, said Vaibhav Poddar, executive vice-president. It already provides X-ray services at home. Dilip Jose, CEO of Manipal Hospitals, says the company will add external partners when it opens more hospitals. He attributes the growth in home healthcare to the demographic shift towards an ageing population. According to a June 2017 United Nations Population Fund report, 19% of India\u2019s population will be above 60 in 2050, in part due to longer life expectancy. As of 2015, it was about 8%.  Stakeholders say dementia, cancer care and pulmonology are growing segments within homecare - pulmonology becoming prominent due to increasingly polluted cities. Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s, both degenerative brain diseases that affect memory, have been linked to loneliness and isolating urban lifestyles.  Busy lifestyles and the prevalence of elderly with limited mobility are contributing to the preference for doorstep medicine delivery and blood tests. This is driving up demand for pharmacists, phlebotomists (people who draw blood) and lab technicians with startups and diagnostic chains.  Manoj Garg, chief human resource officer at Dr Lal PathLabs, says the company is investing in automation and consumer digital services like apps and expanding into Bangladesh and Nepal.  Medlife founder Prashant Singh says the company plans to start a pilot project with 20 home nurses this year. Healthians founder Deepak Sahni says it is expanding to 20 more cities this year, including Kolkata, Chennai , Coimbatore and Mumbai. Demand for lab technicians is expected to rise 16% in 2019-20, while that for pharmacists will grow by 12%, said Mayur Sarswat, head of sales (business development) at TeamLease.  Randstad\u2019s managing director Paul Dupuis says pharmacies will grow at a faster clip than diagnostic labs, given that the latter require greater capital expenditure. MyMedicineBox founder Manmohan Gupta says the company is hiring BSc graduates who would be taught to read prescriptions as pharmacists were expensive. Startups have almost doubled salaries for highly skilled healthcare workers like lab technicians, while those for pharmacists have gone up by as much as 40%.
